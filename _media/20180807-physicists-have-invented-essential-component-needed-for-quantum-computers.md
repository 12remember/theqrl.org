This is set to change as scientists have now shown a magnetised wafer made of a particular topological insulator could do the job, and be made 1,000 times smaller than existing components.

"Such compact circulators could be implemented in a variety of quantum hardware platforms, irrespective of the particular quantum system used," said the study's lead author, Alice Mahoney.

In many respects, we're still at the pre-vacuum-tube and magnetic tape phase of quantum computers â€“ they're more promise than practical.

But if we keep seeing advances like this, it won't be long before we'll be bringing you news of quantum computers cracking problems which leave our best supercomputers gasping.
