Rigetti is hoping to build a functioning computer with 128 qubits in the next 12 months. If successful, it could be the world’s most powerful quantum computer and just might have a chance of outpacing traditional supercomputers. “We’re making very fast, or exponential, progress on all these different fronts,” said Rigetti. “It’s all moving toward a supernova moment, and that is quantum advantage.”
