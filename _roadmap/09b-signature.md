The introduction and solidification of variable key heights and signature space allows us to ensure future compatibility with almost anything. Our blockchain now includes the possibility to upgrade signature schemes (XMSS, SPHINCS, + future) and through an address format update, support different cryptographic hash functions (SHA2_256, SHAKE_128, SHAKE256 etc).
