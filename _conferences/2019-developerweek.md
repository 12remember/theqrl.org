## About DeveloperWeek

Each year, 8,000+ developers, engineers, software architects, dev teams, managers and executives from 70+ countries gather in the SF Bay Area — the world’s epicenter of developer innovation — for DeveloperWeek (Feb 20-24, 2019) to discover the latest in developer technologies, languages, platforms, and tools.

DeveloperWeek 2019 is San Francisco’s largest developer conference & event series with dozens of week-long events including the DeveloperWeek 2019 Conference & Expo, 1,000+ attendee hackathon, 1000+ attendee tech hiring expo, and a series of workshops, open houses, drink-ups, and city-wide events across San Francisco!

Because DeveloperWeek covers all new technologies, our conference and workshops invite you to get intro lessons (or advanced tips and tricks) on technologies like VR Dev, Artificial Intelligence Dev, Blockchain Dev, IoT Dev, Serverless technology, Microservices technology, new JavaScript frameworks, and more.
