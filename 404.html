        <p>Sorry, this page is both neither here 'nor there when observed. This digital phenomenon often occurs when states or groups of characters are scattered or interact in ways such that the quantum state of the web spin independently of the state of the other strings. Even when the characters are separated by a large distance, a digital state must be described for the system as a whole.</p>
        <p>To restore the fabric of time to when things made sense it's imperative to return to the <a href="https://www.google.com">origins of the universe</a> or try your luck in a <a href="https://theqrl.org">superposition</a> - be sure to stretch first and don't forget your towel!</p>
