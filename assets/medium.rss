            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Development updates, Automatic Migration update</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JNTI19fdE7AHHJcdLtC1-Q.png" /></figure><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This past week has been a more-positive-than-usual one in the cryptosphere — locally, our integration with Keybase (blog <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/qrl-and-keybase-84968003bca2">here</a>) went smoothly, and was well received by our users. More generally, the Consensus conference in NYC as well as some dynamic price action, has had the wider blockchain community aflutter with all sorts of proclamations and predictions. As ever, completing one task at QRL just leaves room to attack the next one. In the (relatively) near future we will be able to announce more fun utility added to the QRL ecosystem. For now, the best of what we can talk about is below.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gppZaKrYawY4Vgf0I_uJVg.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>qrl-ledger:</strong> Updating app (adding multitree support)</li><li><strong>block-explorer:</strong> Fix for Q/q in route on address page</li><li><strong>block-explorer: </strong>Bump explorer-helpers version</li></ul><h3>Token Migration Update</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wUksQw4Xu9i1NuyY2ZBRUw.jpeg" /></figure><p><strong>AUTOMATIC TOKEN MIGRATION ENDS JUNE 15, 2019 2000 UTC (</strong><a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/tokenmigration/countdown/"><strong>Countdown</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p><p>As we announced back in April in a <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/automatic-qrl-token-migration-end-date-845f94e3f6d9">dedicated blog</a>, automatic migration will be closed as of <strong>JUNE 15, 2019 2000 UTC. </strong>This will not mark the complete removal of user’s ability to migrate ERC20’s. However, currently the process is <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/tokenmigration/countdown/#migration-steps"><strong>automatic</strong></a><strong> </strong>and can be completed in its entirety by the user. After <strong>JUNE 15, 2019 2000 UTC</strong>, the process will be <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/tokenmigration/countdown/#steps-after-june-15th"><strong>manual</strong></a><strong>,</strong> require interacting with The QRL team in some capacity, and may take an <strong>indeterminate amount of time</strong>. <em>Additionally</em>, each manual migration will be evaluated on a <strong>case-by-case basis</strong>.</p><p>This cannot be stressed enough: every user with ERC20s remaining in their possession, please migrate them to main-network Quanta on the QRL blockchain as soon as it is reasonably possible for you to do so.</p><p>We have already seen a great response from the community, with over half the remaining ERC20s migrated over the past few weeks. We at QRL are very pleased by this, and sincerely hope that migration continues at this rate, leaving little to no ERC20s un-migrated when automatic migration closes (<strong>JUNE 15, 2019 2000 UTC).</strong></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=b46c7251fc34" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-may-14-20-b46c7251fc34">Last Week in QRL May 14–20</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Today however, we are also including breaking news that went live this morning!</p><p>We are happy to report that QRL addresses can now be added to your <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase Identity</a>. We have been eagerly looking forward to this day for the past few weeks/months, and are very excited to be sharing it with you all.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SQm5ZwCZdYRLXwz9em5xLA.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>theqrl.org:</strong> Keybase integrations</li><li><strong>ledger-qrl-app:</strong> cleanup nvram handling + small UI tweaks</li><li><strong>qrl-wallet:</strong> Keybase integration release</li></ul><h3>Keybase</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Vfci4Bj4ypsWmXlLwvjkTQ.png" /></figure><p>As our <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/qrl-and-keybase-84968003bca2">blog earlier this morning</a> announced, you can now add your QRL address to your <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase </a>account to help prove your digital identity. For those unaware, Keybase is a catalog of connected identities that utilizes cryptographic proofs to link profiles. For example, you can currently link your GitHub, Twitter, Reddit, Bitcoin or ZCash addresses (along with ~200 other services) currently to prove your identity. Starting today, QRL addresses may also be used in this manner to prove your digital identity. Obviously, if your QRL address is proving your identity, then your identity is also associated with that QRL address, so make sure you are comfortable with that address being publicly known before associating it with your Keybase account.</p><p>Our <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/qrl-and-keybase-84968003bca2">previous blog</a> has more detailed instructions, but here is a quick rundown:</p><ul><li>In the Keybase app click on the <em>Add more identities </em>button, and select QRL from the list</li><li>Enter your QRL address where it asks for your “username”</li><li>When you submit, it will open a page that looks like this:</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HA9BQKa6y7U_Yzv1wAW0zg.png" /></figure><ul><li>Do not hit “Submit” on this page yet!! Instead, copy the field marked “Signature Hash”</li><li>Open the QRL web or desktop wallet</li><li>Unlock the same wallet whose address you initially entered</li><li>Select “Tools” from the sidebar</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2Ea3iO4_qa53KNz_-EYfrw.png" /><figcaption>Tools section</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Select “Keybase id”</li><li>Enter your Keybase username and Signature Hash into the fields, and send the transaction</li><li>Go check that it was successfully broadcast on our <a href="https://explorer.theqrl.org/">Explorer</a></li><li>Once it is visible on our explorer, head back to the QRL &lt;&gt;Keybase page and hit “Submit”</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xL492bOyywS3WHmrBHvOsQ.png" /><figcaption>Now is the time to hit that button</figcaption></figure><p>Again, there are more detailed instructions in our <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/qrl-and-keybase-84968003bca2">previous blog</a>, and if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to us on Twitter, Discord, or at <a href="mailto:support@theqrl.org">support@theqrl.org</a></p><h3>Community</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/810/1*tLgB0S7qRop_aCVogPLurQ.jpeg" /></figure><p>While we will use this space to highlight our Community Nomination Winner, to organize meetups, or preview upcoming conferences, we also want to use it to highlight when someone from our own community does something cool and relevant. One of our very own community members, Discord user dr_gonzo, attended the <a href="https://bcisummit.com/summit-2019.html">BCI Summit on May 10 in New York City</a>, whose <a href="https://bcisummit.com/agenda-S2019.html">agenda</a> included a panel on Quantum Computer’s Destruction of Security &amp; Blockchain.</p><p>The BCI Summit members and attendees consisted of major accredited investors and C-suite executives from some of the largest companies around the world, including IBM, Barclays, D-Wave, UBS, and more. The “Quantum Computer’s Destruction of Security &amp; Blockchain” panel consisted of industry heavyweights such as the Quantum Computing Lead for NASA, the head of Symantec Ventures, and a Researcher of Quantum Theory for IBM. While the panel focused primarily on alternative algorithms and mining, it also took questions, including one from dr_gonzo who asked about the vulnerability of ECDSA, and noted that projects like our very own QRL exist to address it.</p><p>It is increasingly clear that quantum computing, and the means to resist it on a cryptographic level, are becoming more mainstream topics for discussion. Major institutional players are waking up to the fundamental threat of quantum computing technology to other cryptocurrencies. Thanks to Discord users dr_gonzo for his attendance, and PQAdvantage for helping facilitate the opportunity.</p><p>We are always happy to hear about the wonderful things our community members are getting up to, and, where appropriate, are happy to highlight them in this space. Please feel free to reach out to us on Discord, Twitter, Reddit, or send an email with your cool story to <a href="mailto:adam@theqrl.org">adam@theqrl.org</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=4f70f54e5333" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-may-7-13-4f70f54e5333">Last Week in QRL May 7–13</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Now, without further ado…</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mxCu4J3xHZt-qgs1L62rHA.png" /></figure><p>We are pleased to announce that this month’s QRL Community Nomination Award goes to <a href="https://github.com/IMac318">GitHub user IMac318</a> (reddit handle: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Definitely_Not_IMac">Definitely_Not_IMac</a>)! Here’s what IMac318 had to tell us about themselves and their relationship to the QRL:</p><blockquote>I was someone who got into crypto during the December 2017 hype, because the idea of a trust-less, decentralized financial system seemed like a fascinating and revolutionary idea. Of course, a blockchain’s usefulness is entirely reliant on its security, and while Bitcoin and others seemed virtually impenetrable from classical computing attacks, my background in physics made me wonder how it would stand up to quantum computing attacks.</blockquote><blockquote>It didn’t take very much research to see that nearly all blockchains were vulnerable to quantum computers, but very few people in the space seemed to be aware of this. I figured that any crypto that was serious about being a long-term store of value should be taking this threat seriously, and QRL was the only team that was. Since joining the community, I’ve continued to see future-oriented decisions from the project’s leadership, and it has been exciting to see the progress that has been made in QRL ecosystem. I can’t wait to see what the future holds for this project!</blockquote><p>IMac318 has been a positive member of the QRL community for some time now, and is also the author of <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/tree/master/2.Proposals/1.%20Open/7%20-%20Support%20Tokenization%20of%20Securities">QIP-007: Support Tokenization of Securities</a>. As always, we <em>highly </em>encourage anyone with interest to <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/blob/master/README.md">check out how to submit a QIP</a>. It remains one of the most direct ways to contribute to the QRL ecosystem, as well as the most direct way to make your desires regarding the continued development of QRL known.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ac364919ff9f" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/april-community-nomination-award-ac364919ff9f">April Community Nomination Award</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

At QRL, we are nearing the 1 year anniversary of our blockchain launch (coming in late June). This past week has seen some press coverage (which will be featured moving forward in our “In The News” section of these blogs), development efforts, as well as things we can’t talk about. For what we can, there are highlights below.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*z0AJeiYe_9qltVgp2g7zkw.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>qrl-wallet: </strong>Make build version dynamic</li><li><strong>message-transaction-encoding: </strong>List of encoding bytes for various services using QRL message transactions</li><li><strong>qrl-docker: </strong>Adding auto-generated CircleCI 2.0 config file</li></ul><h3>Community</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UnmlJxDvSBsLOXxfMx9MPQ.png" /></figure><p>As we do every month, we have another QRL Community Nomination Winner this month! Unfortunately, we have not gotten a response from them yet as to whether or not they would like to state anything about their relationship with the QRL network or how they came to be involved in our community. We will include a full write-up of April’s winner in a separate blog later this week, or in next week’s “Last Week in QRL” blog.</p><h3>In The News</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BBJhh7x3g8Va2LaORmo_wA.jpeg" /></figure><p>We are going to be highlighting when QRL ends up in the news, or an interview with one of our team members is published, in these weekly blogs moving forward. We will include a link to the article, a brief summary, and our involvement (if there was any).</p><p>This section won’t necessarily show up every week, but it will appear intermittently as needed. As always, if I have missed any articles, podcasts, etc in this rundown, please email them to me at adam@theqrl.org and they will be included in the next week’s blog. This week, QRL showed up in two articles:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cardrates.com/news/the-qrl-foundation-protects-data-from-quantum-computing-threats/">“The QRL Foundation Protects Data from Quantum Computing Threats”</a> by Adam West of CardRates.com. The article looks at QC, ECDSA, XMSS, and where QRL fits into all of it.

In addition to this there has been the usual development efforts as well as some research into more forward-looking opportunities. As always, the best of what we can talk about is below.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nHS7PWvsegTG5qbGCrTDKQ.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>QRL Block Explorer:</strong> Change to OTS Tracker colors to make them less harsh</li><li><strong>theqrl.org: </strong>Have the down arrow actually go somewhere (H/T to discord user <a href="https://github.com/kuantum">@kuantum</a>#1776 for reporting this error)</li><li><strong>Explorer-helpers: </strong>Fix keybase signature hash display</li></ul><h3>QIP 008: Ephemeral Message Format Proposal</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bnwfORWLZwEHiWConYSRZQ.jpeg" /></figure><p>Barely a week out from the last <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips">QRL Improvement Proposal (QIP)</a>, and the next one arrives — we can only hope for more weeks with as many ideas coming to the fore as this one. Authored by Peter Waterland (<a href="https://github.com/surg0r">GitHub</a>) and Kaushal Singh (<a href="https://github.com/cyyber">GitHub</a>), here is the abstract:</p><blockquote>To extend functionality of the QRL beyond the ledger an off-chain network messaging system known as ‘ephemeral’ is proposed. These lifespan-limited internode broadcast messages may be relayed and stored optionally by agreeable qrl-nodes.</blockquote><blockquote>A simple initial format with some DDOS protection is suggested, allowing custom implementations from users or applications wishing to interact with the QRL ledger/network.</blockquote><p>The full text of the QIP can be found <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/blob/master/2.Proposals/1.%20Open/8%20-%20Ephemeral%20Message%20Format%20Proposal/8%20-%20ephemeral%20message%20format%20proposal.md">here</a>. As always, we highly encourage anyone who is interested to go look at the discussion already occurring on GitHub, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/pull/17">here</a>. Alternatively, there is always an appetite for discussion on our <a href="https://discord.gg/VR9kcs2">Discord</a> server. There will also be a blog specifically on the new QIP at a later date.</p><p>It has been almost 6 months to the day since the first QIP was published. We are currently tracking at a bit over 1 QIP per month, with the interval between QIPs shrinking over time. This is exactly the sort of feedback we were hoping for when creating the QIP system. It is one thing to make systems, it is entirely another thing to see those systems be put to proper and good use. Thank you to everyone who has submitted a QIP, commented on one, or simply discussed them.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=a623b2024959" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-april-23-29-a623b2024959">Last Week in QRL April 23–29</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>An introduction to the newest QIP</em></p><p>On April 19th, GitHub user <a href="https://github.com/IMac318">IMac318</a> submitted the latest QRL Improvement Proposal (QIP) — “QIP-007: Support Tokenization of Securities.” (<a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/tree/master/2.Proposals/1.%20Open/7%20-%20Support%20Tokenization%20of%20Securities">link to QIP</a>) We are always excited to see new QIPs pop up on GitHub, especially when they originate from within our community of users. Certainly, tokenization of securities is an issue that is being debated in various iterations throughout the blockchain world. Security tokens generally, and Security Token Offerings (STOs) more specifically, have risen to the forefront of many debates regarding the next wave of functionality to hit the blockchain ecosystem.</p><p>This blog will provide a general overview of the QIP, but you should feel free to check out our <a href="https://theqrl.org/protocol-updates/">QIP section of the website</a>, or jump in on the conversation <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/pull/15">directly on GitHub</a>.</p><h3>Abstract</h3><blockquote>One of the biggest potential use cases of blockchains in the future is the tokenization of existing securities to be bought and sold by valid parties. Being the only existing blockchain that is quantum resistant from genesis and adding the functionality of smart contracts, QRL is in a unique spot to capitalize on this opportunity. The QRL team should evaluate whether the functionality of the smart contracts that are currently in progress can support the tokenization of securities on the QRL blockchain. If that is not the case, the team should consider adding additional functionality that allows for such tokenization.</blockquote><h3>Motivation</h3><p>Given the length of the motivation statement, I have only included 2 of the paragraphs below, with a link to the full text at the bottom.</p><blockquote>The current usefulness of blockchain is highly debated, and there is much conversation about what “killer app” will eventually drive adoption. One current use of blockchain is speculation, and it is very attractive in this area due to the ability to buy fractions of a coin or token. In contrast, many traditional assets require the purchase of an integer number of the asset. For example, it is difficult to obtain a fraction of a stock or real estate property…</blockquote><blockquote>The purpose of this QIP is to urge the QRL team to evaluate whether or not the in-progress smart-contract functionality can support the creation and exchange of security tokens. QRL smart contracts are limited in functionality compared to ETH (where security token standards are currently being created), so the author does not automatically assume that such functionality currently exists. If it does not, consideration should be given to add such functionality.</blockquote><p>Full text <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/pull/15/commits/4c0d57f7445252e0dcf9db578c948e5ed5c754a5#diff-6ca84c8a1de35376f47274be3c33c93c">here</a></p><h3>Specification</h3><blockquote>QRL already has the ability to create tokens, but to be compliant with regulations, it must be possible to restrict transactions of security tokens between wallets if the sending and receiving wallets do not meet certain criteria (example: <a href="https://thesecuritytokenstandard.org/);">https://thesecuritytokenstandard.org/);</a> therefore, it would have to be possible to make these checks before a token transaction is admitted to the blockchain.</blockquote><h3>Implementation</h3><blockquote>Several entities are working on platforms for tokenization of securities. Polymath, Harbor, Securrency, and tZero are prominent examples. It may be worth reaching out to them for evaluation and implementation.</blockquote><p>We continue to be very proud of the QIP system and are grateful for how the community has thus far embraced it. We hope to continue to see new, interesting and timely QIPs pop up intermittently as time goes on. Hopefully, they will help shape and direct development of the QRL network in such a way that will allow the network to be the best it can be.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d885e8d9aedc" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/qip-007-support-tokenization-of-securities-d885e8d9aedc">QIP-007: Support Tokenization of Securities</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

So far we have <a href="https://discord.gg/qFU3AGW">Russian</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/AcSjhug">Spanish</a> channels, with more to come in the following weeks.</p><p>While this is presently landlocked to Discord, the full intent is that it will eventually reach beyond that, to most social media platforms.</p><h4>Contributors</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/884/1*YedlovyTwfSINRvLuMCdyg.png" /></figure><p>You may have noticed our latest major site update included a contributors section — but not all contributors write code. Some of the best contributions to the QRL ecosystem have come in the form of artwork, the written word, constructive feedback, and outreach. While we’ve recognized these contributors in the form of <em>nominations</em>, we wanted the opportunity to highlight them in another way.</p><p>In addition to that, there’s been a small group of people working behind the scenes, doing an amazing job helping us bring the project to a wider audience. The discussions have been fruitful, and allowed us to access a distilled perspective, from those who are truly passionate about the network.</p><p>These things have been in motion for some time, but we will be able to say more publicly in the coming weeks. Stay tuned!</p><h3>Developments</h3><h4>Testing for GO-QRL</h4><p>Internal testing has commenced for GO-QRL. In the coming weeks, this will go out to #TestPilots — including some documentation and a call for more public testing!</p><h4>Final stages of the mobile wallet</h4><p>We’re on the cusp of a release — as soon as we get Apple’s approval. We know many have been waiting for this to happen, as it completes our ecosystem of front-line products.</p><h4>QIP-007: Support Tokenization of Securities</h4><p>IMac has put together a QRL Improvement Proposal (QIP) for the tokenization of securities.</p><blockquote><strong>Abstract</strong></blockquote><blockquote>One of the biggest potential use cases of blockchains in the future is the tokenization of existing securities to be bought and sold by valid parties.
