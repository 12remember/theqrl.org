            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>What happened at QRL the past week</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2eNwEKRe-3XWv7ZNEm7tgw.png" /></figure><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Adam and James just got back from DeveloperWeek 2019 at the end of last week. This blog will be less brief than we thought it might be, as there is the pleasant surprise of QIP 5 to introduce to everyone. At QRL, we are continuing to perfect existing systems and features, as well as continuing to develop new ones. Below is some of what has been going on the past week.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CiW9ZgDwdARVD_76LwNENw.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>Python Node: </strong>Node with pagination running in devnet</li><li><strong>Python Node: </strong>Address state updated to support multisig</li><li><strong>GoQRL/MongoDB/Explorer: </strong>Explorer being largely refactored (practically rewritten) to take advantage of the rapid speed and reduce node overhead</li><li><strong>Node development: </strong>Go to become primary node implementation in the long term</li></ul><h3>DeveloperWeek 2019</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*XN3dz5ajWVr1xNjmFX8tUA.png" /></figure><p>I will be brief here since we also have our <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-developerweek-2019-b539dc30a146">Reflecting on DeveloperWeek blog</a>. DeveloperWeek 2019 was a success; it was an eminently professional setup, the presentation went well, and it was a massive event that seemed to work like a well-oiled machine.</p><p>After spending so much time in our own particular niche of the wider technical world, it was both refreshing and inspiring to see how much progress is being made in other areas of technology like Artificial Intelligence, and Virtual Reality.</p><h3>QIP 5: Extending Message transaction Functionality</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/639/1*TJxmqR3MCHUak_0ezgjz3w.jpeg" /></figure><p>Another week, another <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips">QRL Improvement Protocol (QIP)</a>. The newest QIP on the block(chain) is <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/blob/master/2.Proposals/1.%20Open/5%20extended%20message%20format.md">QIP 5: Extending Message tx Functionality</a>. As always, we highly encourage everyone to go read the QIPs in full for themselves. Here is the abstract:</p><blockquote>Message transactions sent on the QRL blockchain network allow broadcast and decentralised storage of 80 bytes of data per transaction for purposes such as notarisation and data stamping. This minor QIP extends the message transaction format to include an optional payee/receipt address.</blockquote><p>We are very excited at the potential of the QIP system, and are very heartened by the QIPs we have seen so far. Whether a given QIP is ultimately integrated or not, we believe that the discussions they inspire are helpful for the growth of the QRL network. Without properly discussing both the necessary next steps, as well as the paths not taken, we cannot be sure that QRL will continue to be the best decentralized blockchain network that it can be. As always, we <em>highly </em>encourage anyone with interest to submit a QIP. It remains one of the most direct ways to contribute to the overall QRL ecosystem, as well as a way to make your desires regarding the continued development of QRL known.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=647f2ab91a14" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-feb-18-25-2019-647f2ab91a14">Last Week in QRL Feb 19–25, 2019</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>TL;DR — Spoke at and attended DeveloperWeek 2019 in Oakland with James</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uqyvUN3A2YYFeX5N8FlPLg.jpeg" /></figure><h3>Setting the Scene</h3><p>This past week, James and I attended <a href="https://www.developerweek.com/">DeveloperWeek 2019</a> in Oakland, California. It was held at the <a href="http://www.oaklandconventioncenter.com/">Oakland Convention Center</a>, located near downtown Oakland. DeveloperWeek is a massive conference, expo, hackathon, and hiring expo that spans 5 days and attracts over 8,000 attendees. To say that it was massive is an understatement.</p><p>In my time at QRL I have only been to one conference that matched the intensity and scale of DeveloperWeek — Consensus 2018. However, while Consensus was massive, it was still an undertaking that was focused on blockchain and cryptocurrency. DeveloperWeek is relatively more broad. In no particular order, DeveloperWeek 2019 had tracks focused on <a href="https://www.developerweek.com/conference/conference-schedule/">VR/AR</a>, <a href="https://www.developerweek.com/conference/popular-programming-languages-frameworks/">popular coding languages</a>, <a href="https://www.developerweek.com/conference/next-generation-languages/">next generation coding languages</a>, <a href="https://www.developerweek.com/conference/the-future-of-developer-tools/">future of development tools</a>, <a href="https://www.developerweek.com/conference/new-database-technologies/">new database technologies</a>, <a href="https://www.developerweek.com/conference/blockchain-development/.">blockchain</a>, <a href="https://www.developerweek.com/conference/artificial-intelligence-dev-conference/">AI</a>, <a href="https://www.developerweek.com/conference/apis-microservices-track/">APIs</a>, and <a href="https://www.developerweek.com/conference/javascript-conference/">JavaScript</a>, among others. As compared to the niche of blockchain/cryptocurrency, DeveloperWeek covers quite a wide scope of topics.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*XN3dz5ajWVr1xNjmFX8tUA.png" /></figure><h3>A New Standard</h3><p>DeveloperWeek was not only one of the largest conferences I have had the opportunity to attend in my role at QRL — it was easily the most professional and pleasant set up I have interacted with as a speaker. Once on stage, it is all up to the presenter, but there is much that can help put someone in a position to succeed before they step on stage. Things like regular communication in the weeks/months before the event, clearly marking all locations at the event, having dedicated A/V managers for each stage, standardized presentation format to reduce visual irregularities, presentation rooms with good/neutral acoustics, and last (but certainly not least) — keeping everything on schedule so that people know where they need to be, when they need to be. I am happy to report that in all of these areas DeveloperWeek excelled.</p><p>In the 10 or so presentations I have given on behalf of QRL, I have seen a wide variety of setup and execution. DeveloperWeek is now the conference that I can hold up as the gold standard of front and back-end logistics. Given that it was also the longest presentation I have given, for one of the larger audiences, it made the experience that much more pleasant that it was handled so professionally.</p><h3>The Presentation</h3><p>My presentation at DeveloperWeek 2019 was titled, “Quantum Computing and the Blockchain/Cryptocurrency Community.” I was given 50 minutes to present (35–45 minute presentation + 5–15 minute Q&amp;A), which was more than we are usually given (most conferences we have 20–30 minutes total). While anyone would appreciate extra time to explain things, given what a complex topic quantum computing is, especially at DeveloperWeek, the extra time was valued. That is because I had the opportunity to present to what was probably the most technically literate audience I’ve had access to. This was not only evidenced in the rapt attention and looks of comprehension I saw on the faces on various audience members, but in the quality of questions I received, both during the Q&amp;A section, as well as after my talk had concluded.</p><p>One such question that I want to highlight here came from a gentlemen who inquired about the open-source nature of QRL (that is to say, whether or not we were open-source). He wanted to make sure that if we were developing solutions, that people would be able to access them, and potentially learn from them. As a reminder, QRL is and will continue to be under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT Open Source License</a>. Blockchain would not be here today if it was not for the open source development community, and QRL remains steadfast in its commitment to giving back to that community, as well as helping to propagate it through the use of the MIT License and thorough documentation.</p><p>In addition, James was able to capture a video of my presentation that we plan on editing (potentially into smaller, bite-sized videos), and putting up on our YouTube page (which will be linked to Medium and elsewhere). Stay tuned!</p><h3>Final Thoughts</h3><p>In terms of conferences, 2019 has certainly started off on a high note. While our 2019 schedule is still taking shape, it is unlikely, for a number of reasons, that we will match the sheer intensity of the conference schedule we had in 2018. We want to make fewer appearances and have a greater impact.</p><p>While we did not end up having a formal supporter meetup due to logistic issues, informally I ran into some people who either were aware of, or had directly used the QRL network. I do not think I will ever tire of those experiences.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=b539dc30a146" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-developerweek-2019-b539dc30a146">Reflecting on DeveloperWeek 2019</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Next week’s “Last Week in QRL” blog will likely be brief, as there will be a typical “Reflections” blog on DeveloperWeek out as well. We are starting off our conference attendance with a bang in 2019, as DeveloperWeek’s attendance will likely eclipse even that of Consensus last year, as well as covering a broader scope.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HwoygmrZ0lqp9nBbUmjyLg.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>Offline Wallet Generator: </strong>fix: long-style v-on and v-bind</li><li><strong>Mobile Wallet:</strong> v1.0.8 update</li><li><strong>Mobile Wallet:</strong> Wallet creation test using Appium</li><li><strong>Mobile Wallet:</strong> Simple end-to-end test using Detox</li><li><strong>API:</strong> Adding Explorer API Documentation</li></ul><h3>QIP 4: Multi-Signature Wallet</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Z_ZjOpYV4iiy7ik3JM0Lvw.jpeg" /></figure><p>For those of you unfamiliar, our <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips">QRL Improvement Protocol (QIP)</a> is the vehicle through which we hope to drive much of the serious discussion around specific feature development. To review, some of the first QIPs were regarding <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/tree/master/2.Proposals/1.%20Open/1%20Cryptonote%20v8">Cryptonight V8</a> and <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/tree/master/2.Proposals/1.%20Open/2%20-%20MessageTransaction%20Encoded%20Message%20Standard">A standard message encoding format to indicate encoded data</a>. They live over on our <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips">GitHub</a> and we encourage members of the community to comment, create and discuss them there.</p><p>The most recent QIP is <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/blob/master/2.Proposals/1.%20Open/4%20Multi-signature%20wallet.md">QIP4: Multi-Signature Wallets</a> — if you feel inclined to read it yourself, we highly encourage it! As the QIP states, multi-signature wallets, “allow multiple authorities to have a transaction from a single wallet once consent has been established.”</p><p>Generally speaking, multi-signature wallets allow for more complex uses of a wallet. One such example would be a team within a company, with 5 people, where 3 of the 5 needed to approve any expenditure for a given project. With a multi-signature wallet, they could ensure that in order for funds to be spent, 3 of the 5 signatures associated with the wallet would need to be employed.</p><h3>Upcoming Conference</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*XN3dz5ajWVr1xNjmFX8tUA.png" /></figure><p>Adam and James will be heading out to Oakland tomorrow to present at and attend DeveloperWeek 2019. You can see a preview of what Adam will be presenting <a href="https://developerweek2019.sched.com/speaker/adam_koltun.1yz9ak9c">here</a>. You can find all the details about DeveloperWeek 2019 and our involvement in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/developerweek-2019-this-week-8992e1c38434">our preview blog</a>. As always, we will have a reflections blog following the conference. Be on the lookout for the blog the week following their return from DeveloperWeek.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f21e59181742" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-feb-11-18-2019-f21e59181742">Last Week in QRL Feb 11–18 2019</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Developer technology, from blockchain and artificial intelligence to big data and quantum computing represents fundamental innovation that people can build on for years. We are in the DevTech Age, where developer technologies and tools are now the most disruptive and fundamental technology innovation in the marketplace.</p><h3>Where</h3><p><a href="http://www.oaklandconventioncenter.com/">Oakland Convention Center</a>, Oakland, California</p><h3>When</h3><p>February 20–24th, 2019</p><h3>Why</h3><p>When we were approached with the opportunity to present at DeveloperWeek 2019, we immediately realized that this was an opportunity worth taking. DeveloperWeek is one of (if not the) premiere development-centric events in the United States each year, and 2019 is no exception. While we have spoken to audiences that skewed more technical before, we have not had a chance to speak to a crowd like the one we will probably have at DeveloperWeek.</p><p>It’s location in Oakland obviously situates it in the middle of Silicon Valley, the area with the densest location of tech companies, innovation, and development in America. Additionally, we have been granted a longer-than-average speaking slot, as compared to other conferences we have attended (usually presentations are 20–30 minutes, we have 50 at DeveloperWeek).</p><p>Finally, due to a host of factors across the industry and within our own project, we are going to be more selective about which conferences/events we attend in 2019. We have certainly set the bar high with DeveloperWeek as our first outing of the year.</p><h3>Supporter Meetup</h3><p>Due to the tightness of our schedules and the scale of the response we received, we will not be having an official supporter meetup while we are in Oakland. However, if you are going to be at the actual conference, feel free to message us on Twitter or Discord and we may be able to meet up and say Hi, time allowing.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=8992e1c38434" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/developerweek-2019-this-week-8992e1c38434">DeveloperWeek 2019 this week!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Last Week in QRL January 29 — February 4 2019</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ld8-83XE3Rc3mhTPeCYI8w.png" /></figure><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Some of what is in this blog might seem somewhat truncated — that is because we are only able to share so much on certain subjects, and are of the opinion that a brief preview is better than silence on an issue. As we continue to move into 2019, we will continue to provide these regularly scheduled updates, as well as other updates for specific events.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2G80AfvYyqpjO-1pMfyRhg.png" /></figure><ul><li><strong>API:</strong> Updated address verification documentation</li><li><strong>Ledger: </strong>Adding Ledger Nano S Documentation for QRL App</li><li><strong>Offline Wallet Generator:</strong> Nearing release, new UI/UX (more below)</li><li><strong>Mobile wallet: </strong>Code QA underway, CI/Automated test suite planned</li><li><strong>Website: </strong>Website multilingual support and Polyglot integration in development</li><li><strong>Python node:</strong> OTS bit counter being removed and being replaced with paginated key counter</li><li><strong>MongoDB: </strong>2 hours to sync address state to MongoDB</li></ul><h3>Publicity</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/574/1*5ITCQIlnPRRnEffMSKQT_g.png" /></figure><p>A few weeks ago, we were approached by a writer from The Fintech Times, Matthew Dove. He sent us over a handful of questions related to Quantum Computing and its variable applications, both as a constructive tool, and as a breaker of encrypted systems. You can read more about it in the <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/stepping-outside-our-bubble-the-fintech-times-quantum-leap-4260dec59b4a">blog we wrote on it</a>, or just <a href="https://thefintechtimes.com/quantum-leap-1/">read the article itself</a>. It was exciting to be approached by a publication that is non-endemic to the blockchain industry, and being the only representative of our industry in the article was very fulfilling.</p><h3>Ledger App</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/449/1*aO1bGLiWLcy6CGs2aHGgBw.png" /></figure><p>Our Ledger app is now complete (pending full release from Ledger)! It can now be found (along with installation instructions) at the <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/wallet/ledger-nano-s/">QRL Documentation</a> site. As always, DO NOT USE THIS APP ON A LEDGER WITH ACTUAL FUNDS IN ITS CURRENT STATE.</p><p>There is no penalty to waiting for the full release of the Ledger app. However, we have received word from some within the community that they wanted to test out the application (again, NOT ON A LEDGER WITH ACTUAL FUNDS), so we decided to provide the opportunity, for those interested and able.</p><h3>Offline Wallet Generator</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/919/1*5pndiSPltfzFki7t16wWbA.png" /></figure><p>As we discussed in our previous <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-jan-22-jan-28-2019-23cfdbb15e18">Last Week in QRL blog</a> — a great deal of progress has been made in the development of the QRL Offline Wallet Generator. We are happy to show off the above screenshot of the UI (as with anything, subject to change) of our Offline Wallet Generator. Being able to generate one’s own wallet, on one’s own machine, with no connection to the internet required, achieves both greater security and greater variety for our users.</p><p>At QRL we are always working towards giving the greatest diversity of reasonable options to our users, and we are happy to see this additional element coming to fruition. If you would like to follow along with the development progress more closely, you can watch the <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/offline-wallet-generator">relevant GitHub repo</a> at your leisure.</p><h3>Community</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*d65j1PcQVrdBPTyMTinCPQ.png" /></figure><p>We are happy to announce that Discord user Cingulate is January’s QRL Community Award Winner! Cingulate has been a constructive member of the community for awhile now, and has also been very helpful in our community insider’s group in advancing meaningful discussions and providing useful insights.</p><p>We asked Cingulate how they became acquainted with The Quantum Resistant Ledger, “I heard someone mention quantum computing in relation to crypto last October, and then did my own research, and found QRL. The rest is history. Came for the unique use-case, stayed for the intelligent and engaging community.”</p><h3>Facebook</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7DDT7zIuqNylApVQGUOhwg.png" /><figcaption>Our new Facebook page</figcaption></figure><p>As most of you are aware, our central community hubs are Discord and Reddit. Discord is where the most lively and consistent conversations happen, and Reddit is where an avenue where conversations that take place over greater periods of time can sometimes be easier to have.</p><p>Our Facebook page has never been the center of our social media strategy, but it is a component nonetheless. We have recently updated our Facebook page, and are happy to show it off now. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/The-Quantum-Resistant-Ledger-492163101309701/">Link to the page</a></p><h3>Looking Forward</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/326/1*VKaWpkExV_9rzvzQ1PBJlg.png" /></figure><p>As many of you have already noticed, there is a new addition to the footer of theqrl.org — The QRL Foundation! From the outset, this project has had the goal of setting up a foundation to handle all manner of things in a responsible and effective manner. More info to come on this (in the form of a dedicated blog), but since we already have it up on the website, we figured we would illuminate the reason as to why (with, again, more details to come later). Those details may be a few months in the making, as there is a basic probationary period in Switzerland for these things, but make no mistake, when we can be more verbose on the subject, we will be.</p><p>We are always happy to check off a box that is still with us from 2017, and at this point, there are precious few remaining.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=93abe4d5a886" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-january-29-february-4-2019-93abe4d5a886">Last Week in QRL January 29 — February 4 2019</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>TL;DR — We were approached a few weeks ago by </em><a href="https://thefintechtimes.com/"><em>The Fintech Times</em></a><em> writer Matthew Dove, who asked us for our opinions on a number of Quantum Computing related issues. We provided quotes, some of which made it into today’s cover story for TFT, </em><a href="https://thefintechtimes.com/quantum-leap-1/"><em>“Quantum Leap”</em></a></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/574/1*5ITCQIlnPRRnEffMSKQT_g.png" /></figure><p>At QRL, we pride ourselves on two things, primarily; our work ethic, and our ability to collaborate effectively as a team. Increasingly, our ability to act as an ambassador and advocate for not just blockchain technology, but also, for lack of a better term, for greater quantum computing awareness, has made that list. We have been approached in the past for quotes on various blockchain and quantum computing related issues. Some of these end up in articles, including, recently, being asked by BlockTribune.com to give some <a href="https://blocktribune.com/blockchain-and-cryptocurrency-predictions-vol-ix/">predictions for blockchain in 2019</a>.</p><p>However, we have never found ourselves being asked to contribute to an article that stretches as far out of our little niche of blockchain (and into a larger niche, that of fintech), while still addressing what the fundamental relationship between network technologies and quantum computers is likely to be in the near future, and what we need to do to prepare for it.</p><p>We are humbled to have been the only blockchain project represented in the article, and we feel that we represented our point of view well; not engaging in fear-mongering, nor dismissing the very real disruptive potential of this emerging technology.</p><p>We recognize that as the first fully functional blockchain network secured by a quantum-resistant signature scheme, we have to both act as trailblazer, representative, and advocate if we are to help raise the awareness of the inevitability of quantum computing, and all that must be done now to protect our future networks from it.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=4260dec59b4a" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/stepping-outside-our-bubble-the-fintech-times-quantum-leap-4260dec59b4a">Stepping Outside Our Bubble: The Fintech Times’ “Quantum Leap”</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This week’s blog will be slightly shorter than some in the past. As always, the length/depth of these blogs is only representative of those efforts of ours that are fit to be shared. As the old saying goes, “Still waters run deep.”</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/556/1*F7QDPyig4qBV4WNrekTALw.png" /></figure><ul><li><strong>Android:</strong> Solved issue related to the wrong amount transferred in mobile wallet</li><li><strong>iOS:</strong> Solved issue related to the QRL wallet address not updating after QR code was scanned in for</li><li><strong>Mobile Wallet:</strong> App stores submission processes to begin next week</li><li><strong>API:</strong> Pagination near completion — to be launched into devnet</li><li><strong>Offline Wallet Generator:</strong> Basic styling, end-to-end testing added to printout</li><li><strong>GO-QRL Node:</strong> Added MongoDB authentication support and updated unit tests</li><li><strong>Ledger:</strong> Code review underway by Ledger team</li></ul><h3>Liquidity</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*smrhDQ8haodyGdIB6BuuQQ.jpeg" /></figure><p>As you are already aware, Liqui delisted the QRL ERC20 token back in November. At the time we described it as largely inconsequential, as there was no significant volume on Liqui, we are a fully-fledged blockchain, and the ERC20 is just a leftover from the time before we launched. As a sort of follow up to that story, it now appears that Liqui will be closing its doors for good. <a href="https://liqui.io/">Per their website</a>, “Liqui is no longer able to provide liquidity for the Users left. We also do not see any economic point in providing you with our services. However, we do not want to return to where we were a month ago. Hence, we decided to close all accounts and stop providing our services,” the statement also says, “You will be able to withdraw your Digital Assets through our website within 30 days after this message was sent.” The message was posted to Liqui on January 28th, 2019.</p><p>We encourage any QRL users who may have any cryptocurrencies on Liqui, to immediately move your funds, as in 30 days they may be unreachable. Events such as this remind us that while, from a user’s perspective, exchanges may seem incredibly similar, if not indistinguishable, that there is still a significant degree of diversity, and that not all exchanges are created equal.</p><h3>Community</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1mdVsD-puBnskbjau-dBmw.jpeg" /><figcaption>Neil Armstrong next to the X15 rocket-powered aircraft after a research flight</figcaption></figure><p>As we wrote in a <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-at-qrl-jan-15th-21st-7307be422bc9">previous-blog</a>, we are still on the lookout for interested community members to fill out our test pilot program, and anyone interested should fill out the google form we have for test pilots — <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/OPWoEoEVOtxYjEhB3">https://goo.gl/forms/OPWoEoEVOtxYjEhB3</a></p><p>Additionally, stay tuned — next week we will be announcing January’s Community Award Winner! In the meantime, our group of community insiders has continued to be a very useful sounding board and internal reference as we continue to develop documents for the FAQQ site, which we outlined in a <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-jan-7-jan-14-2019-aba7bb87dd38">different-but-also-previous-blog</a>.</p><h3>Upcoming Conference</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*XN3dz5ajWVr1xNjmFX8tUA.png" /></figure><p>Flights are booked, schedules are coalescing, and the final tune-up is being done on <a href="https://developerweek2019.sched.com/speaker/adam_koltun.1yz9ak9c">Adam’s presentation</a> for <a href="https://www.developerweek.com/">Developer Week 2019</a>.

Which leads to the next advancement to the QRL ecosystem</p><h4>Offline Wallet Generator</h4><p>While it’s possible to generate a wallet <em>offline</em> with our current web and desktop wallets, an initial connection to a server is made. <em>Soon</em> it will be possible to load a few files (currently &lt;5 mb in size) on a USB Flash drive and generate wallets on an airgapped machine, negating the need to even instantiate a connection.</p><p>The work is done, it just needs to be cleaned up and put out for preliminary testing among our TestPilots (more below)</p><h4>QRL Mobile Wallet</h4><p>The QRL mobile wallet for iOS and Android has successfully gone through the initial round of community testing! As there were quite a few bugs squished and UI/UX improvements, there will be another round for our TestPilots to break in the coming week(s).</p><h4>QRL Faucet</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/846/1*i1zcVDZsvHVD0JQD7dgM4A.png" /></figure><p>The QRL Faucet, a <em>much</em>-requested feature, has been built! It has passed through an initial, internal test, and is currently undergoing additional, external testing from our group of community ‘TestPilots’ before being given wider release.</p><p>This faucet will function on both the test network and main network. It will issue tiny amounts of QRL in exchange for a brief browser PoW calculation, and is overall rate limited, to prevent over-eager users from draining the faucet balance too quickly. For those interested in seeing how our blockchain works, we hope that this will act as a pleasant introduction to our ecosystem.</p><h3>Community</h3><h4>QuantumFAQ/FAQQ Updates</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/788/1*IeGSNUriu2SgAYHGOnMfmA.png" /></figure><p>As we covered in our <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-jan-7-jan-14-2019-aba7bb87dd38">last blog</a>, QuantumFAQ is an initiative to collect, articulate, and easily reference common misconceptions people have about blockchain and quantum computing.</p><p>One of the first changes was a name-change from QuantumFAQ to FAQQ (Frequently asked quantum questions) which was suggested by the community and voted in by a landslide. This means it also lives in a slightly different location: <a href="https://jackalyst.github.io/faqq/">https://jackalyst.github.io/faqq/</a></p><p>Other changes are:</p><ul><li>A “Footnotes” section so that all of our statements are sourced.</li><li>Separation between assertive statement FAQ’s and FAQ’s that’s geared towards misconceptions &amp; clarifications: “Quantum computers are coming” vs “Bitcoin will just hardfork”</li><li>A better table of contents that should be more effective at guiding people.</li></ul><p>There is still a lot of work to do filling things out and getting the language top notch but continuous progress is being made. If you see any errors, or if there are any misconceptions you would like to see covered, let us know through one of our channels!</p><p>As a note, FAQ’s that pertain to QRL will still live at <a href="https://theqrl.org/faq/">https://theqrl.org/faq/</a>. FAQQ is more of a community initiative geared towards Quantum Computing and Blockchain in general.</p><h4>The QRL TestPilot Program</h4><p>We now have a test pilot program! This is a <strong><em>discord only</em></strong> program and involves being part of the initial round of testing of a variety things before they go out to the wider community.</p><p>The general release overview is:</p><ol><li>Development/production</li><li>QRL Team Review (Round 1, 2, …): Catches initial show stopping bugs and reveals possible security considerations.</li><li><strong>QRL Test Pilot Review (Round 1, 2, …): Catches more show stopping bugs through device variability. Also highlights user interaction issues.</strong></li><li>Where applicable, a 3rd party audit.</li><li>General Release.</li></ol><p>While right now there are 7 excellent people that’s part of the test pilot program, and we’d like to expand this to achieve more test coverage.</p><p>If you’re interested please fill out our lovely google form: <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/BCFM1RYUC4S6DrCz1">https://goo.gl/forms/BCFM1RYUC4S6DrCz1</a></p><h4>December Community Award — 0xFF</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*S_9FKunWUpeukHCUbYeRHQ.png" /></figure><p>Our community award goes to 0xFF for contributing to community spirit with excellent puzzles, and for helping to spearhead a larger puzzle initiative that will be announced in the future.</p><h3>In the media</h3><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FPKe6Q6bIl7k%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DPKe6Q6bIl7k&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FPKe6Q6bIl7k%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/4b79dd45198d2fbaf9ea38c92e0a5386/href">https://medium.com/media/4b79dd45198d2fbaf9ea38c92e0a5386/href</a></iframe><p>Adam Koltun had a productive interview with the folks over at CryptoBeadles that went live this past week. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcE2GkGcKxHjZoMVM7tjmyA">CryptoBeadles is a YouTube channel</a> with over 70,000 subscribers, dozens of videos, and has been covering the blockchain/cryptocurrency scene since 2017.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>TL;DR — Ledger app is complete, awaiting final review. Automatic migration will close 3 months after Ledger app goes live. Instructional video on YouTube. More tech details to follow in a later blog.</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cQFoUJ7L0whRF8SFLYvXyw.png" /></figure><h3>Development Progress</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mE3FbEKaBZFMc6hVNv_TbQ.jpeg" /></figure><p>As we have previously communicated, the development of the Ledger app is complete. All that remains now is for Ledger to internally review it, give it their stamp of approval, and add our application to the list of approved applications for Ledger hardware.</p><p>We do not have any specific dates or timelines available to us, but rest assured that as soon as we have any actionable knowledge, we will share that on all social media (and probably write a blog about it as well).</p><p>More detailed information of everything that went into the development of this app will be forthcoming in a blog by our own developer Scott Donald.</p><h3>Automatic Migration</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*IEvy90uMhHVDz6y4Ywwe0Q.jpeg" /></figure><p>We are aware that there are many in the community that have been waiting on the completion and deployment of the Ledger application before migrating their ERC20s. As Ledger goes, so they go.</p><p>With that in mind, we have decided to peg the closure of the <a href="https://migration.theqrl.org/">automatic token migration app</a> to the launch of the Ledger app, as to do otherwise would run the risk of people who were waiting for Ledger not being able to access automatic migration if they wished. <strong>The automatic token migration app will be closed 3 months after the launch of the Ledger app.</strong></p><p>As we have stated previously, <strong>even after automatic token migration closes, users will still be able to migrate their coins.</strong> The migration will no longer be <em>automatic</em>, but it will still be <em>possible</em>. This ensures greater oversight and security of the later migrations, without leaving anyone out in the cold that ends up wanting to migrate their ERC20s into mainnet Quanta at a later date.</p><h3>How To Video</h3><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FNL_u9biLy1g%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DNL_u9biLy1g&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FNL_u9biLy1g%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/43eaedbd6040b4e280addd9df5a4279e/href">https://medium.com/media/43eaedbd6040b4e280addd9df5a4279e/href</a></iframe><p>The above video was recorded by QRL’s own Scott Donald, and shows how one can easily access their wallet and move funds using their Ledger Nano. We wanted to provide users with this information ahead of time, so that when the application goes live on Ledger, there is no gap waiting for instructions.</p><p>We know that Ledger integration has been a top priority for a portion of our community since before we even launched the blockchain. We are very excited at how close we are to being able to say that the Ledger application is functional, live, and available.</p><p>Thank you for your patience.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=eb89bcc5e657" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/ledger-app-update-eb89bcc5e657">Ledger App Update!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
