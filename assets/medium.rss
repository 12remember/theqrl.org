            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Development Updates, One Year Anniversary Coming Soon, Market Availability Update</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dC5OUM-K2vX7GaNevvJMkw.png" /></figure><h3>One Year Anniversary</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ept5R8Evq0wtVXQ6WXQOuA.jpeg" /></figure><p>In the world of blockchain it is said that a day feels like a week, a week feels like a month, and every season feels like a new year. This is perhaps doubly true when it is the first year of a blockchain’s existence. In many ways, it feels both longer <em>and </em>shorter than a year, but sure enough this Wednesday, June 26th, it will be the one year anniversary of the launch of the QRL blockchain. We will have a dedicated blog on the day of recounting some of the accomplishments of the past year. We would like to thank everyone who has been with us on the journey so far, and we are very excited for what the next year holds both for us and the wider blockchain industry.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OhNo_CFeqF8VKdMcG2hfwg.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>go-qrl:</strong> Deadlock fixes for peer + Code simplification</li><li><strong>wallet-helpers: </strong>Increase test coverage to 100%</li><li><strong>docs.theqrl.org: </strong>Post automatic token migration updates</li></ul><h3>Market Availability Update</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1grthy0mA7x06j7iFn5Q8g.png" /></figure><p>At the tail end of last week, there was the additional geofencing of 42 digital assets by Bittrex (read their announcement <a href="https://bittrex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029523891-Market-Availability-Changes-for-U-S-Customers-6-28-19">here</a>). This brings up the current total to 74, and underlines the need for more regulatory clarity in the United States. As always, the QRL Foundation supports regulatory clarity, and legislation that helps further innovation. We will continue to try and stay as informed on these topics as we can be and will report as much as we are able to, when we are able to. For now, know that market availability is something that the project recognizes as a priority, and we understand the role it plays in facilitating the overall health of the ecosystem.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=7c0726ef3d0c" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-june-18-24-7c0726ef3d0c">Last Week in QRL June 18–24</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Overall, automatic token migration ran for ~12 months, and saw the successful transfer of around 90% of the ERC20 population. During those 12 months, there were a number of somewhat predictable flurries of activity; the start of migration, shortly before/after the blockchain launched, and as we approached the final deadline for automatic token migration.</p><p>During the entire run, there were no reported instances of tokens being lost in migration. Support requests were relatively few and far between, which is a positive indication of the robustness of the process. We would first like to credit our developers for their diligent work in creating, managing, and supporting the automatic token migration application. Without them, automatic migration never would have been possible, and without their attention to detail, it could have been a truly ugly mess.</p><p>We would also like to thank our community; not only was the response to our calls for migration significant, but we regularly witnessed community members spreading the word about migration and helping others (particularly in Discord) who were confused about the process. Thank you for helping to ensure that token migration has so far been such an effective endeavor.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=3228fedb56b8" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-june-11-17-3228fedb56b8">Last Week in QRL June 11–17</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On June 26th, 2018, we launched our QRL mainnet network and opened up our automatic token migration which has operated successfully and without a single incident reported.</p><p>This is thanks to the software that’s been written, and vetted, by several members of the QRL team. In addition, the diligent oversight of every migration that’s come through has ensured that the process has been smooth.</p><p>There came a time, however, for automatic token migration to end, and manual token migration to begin. As of today, June 15th, 2019, automatic token migration is closed.</p><p>This is the first step before ending migration completely.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zT-9cr4qr_CZ1Wz09kQmYA.jpeg" /><figcaption>Migration is now manual — from pixabay user <a href="https://pixabay.com/users/leoleobobeo-1487549/">leoleobobeo</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Common questions</h3><h4>“I forgot/procrastinated/missed the memo to migrate! Is it too late?”</h4><p>If you still haven’t migrated your QRL ERC20 tokens to mainnet, you will need to follow these steps for manual migration:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: A QRL User will email <a href="mailto:support@theqrl.org">support@theqrl.org</a> with a QRL mainnet address the user created (QRL addresses that start with a Q).</li><li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Support (via <a href="mailto:support@theqrl.org">support@theqrl.org</a>) will respond to the user with an ETH ERC20 burn address.</li><li><strong>Step 3</strong>: User will send QRL ERC20s to the ETH burn address sent via email.</li><li><strong>Step 4</strong>: QRL address provided by user will be sent Quanta at a 1:1 ratio to ERC20s burnt.</li><li><strong>Step 5</strong>: User will now have 1 Quanta in their QRL address for every 1 ERC20 they sent to their burn address.</li></ul><p>While this guide is current, it may at some point become out of date. An up-to-date guide lives at our documentation site: <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/tokenmigration/newguide/">https://docs.theqrl.org/tokenmigration/newguide/</a> (note: link not currently active and is just undergoing review)</p><h4>I have QRL on Bittrex, is it migrated/when will they migrate?</h4><p>The QRL on Bittrex is our mainnet coin as they have already performed the QRL migration last year.</p><p>There is no need to migrate these coins.</p><h4>What will happen to the QRL ERC20 tokens and reserved Quanta after the final migration end-date?</h4><p>At no point in time will the Quanta be accessible to the Foundation.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Development Updates, Token Migration Reminder, Bittrex US Geofencing</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NFSCc6BvXoQBC8RaKWa7Cg.png" /></figure><h3>Introduction</h3><p>There is never a dull week in blockchain, and this past one was no exception. Bittrex announced that it was geofencing 32 crypto assets from United States customers Friday (more on this below), and significant progress has been made on further integrating Ledger. This is also the last “Last Week” blog before the end of Automatic Token Migration later this week on <strong>June 15, 2019 3:00 pm UTC-05:00</strong>, so we will have another reminder regarding that at the end of the blog.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rcLJwEwLoBrJ9Fs95QZKRA.png" /></figure><ul><li><strong>ledger-live: </strong>Work on integration underway (more in <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/dev-meetings/blob/master/2019/06/06.md">dev meeting notes</a>)</li><li><strong>ledger: </strong>New BOLOS app (Nano S/X, multitree) with WebUSB-ready supporting library awaiting review by Ledger</li><li><strong>wallet:</strong> Pagination support underway: discussed adding this to explorer-helpers to allow recycling of code in explorer</li></ul><h3>Community</h3><p>We recognize that between the closure of automatic token migration at the end of the week (check out the <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/tokenmigration/countdown/">countdown</a>), and the recent Bittrex geofencing news (dedicated blog <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/geofencing-of-crypto-assets-b800494f0c6d">here</a>), that a lot of information has been coming at the QRL community. We wanted to thank our community members for being so supportive of one another and quickly stepping up to disseminate information among one another.</p><p>This is probably most evident on Discord, where newcomers are oftentimes given a bevvy of information upon entering the server for the first time and asking some “What’s all this?” type questions. A coin is only ever as strong as its community, and it is encouraging to see so much passion from ours.</p><h3>Bittrex Geofencing of United States Customers</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zAREr3w_wSv5wAPPZGD8gA.jpeg" /></figure><p>As we wrote in a <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/geofencing-of-crypto-assets-b800494f0c6d">previous blog</a>, Bittrex recently announced that it was geofencing 32 crypto assets, including QRL, from US customers on 2019–06–21.</p><p>Trading for non-US customers will continue unchanged on the Bittrex International platform.</p><p>You can read the full announcement <a href="https://bittrex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028996652">here</a>.</p><p>While this will not halt development progress on the project, the near term priority for the project will be procuring an additional listing on a major Asian exchange as soon as is practical.</p><h3>Automatic Token Migration</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*x37t9zJwA4zcg7tH9XvxMg.jpeg" /></figure><p>The current token migration process is <strong>automatic </strong>once you have started the process<strong> </strong>and <strong>almost immediate</strong>.</p><p><em>After</em> <strong>June 15, 2019 3:00 pm UTC-05:00</strong>, however, the process for migrating ERC20s will be <strong>manual,</strong> and may take an <strong>indeterminate amount of time</strong>. <em>Additionally</em>, each manual migration will be evaluated on a <strong>case-by-case basis</strong>.</p><p>It’s <em>strongly</em> recommended that any and all users who still have QRL ERC20’s to migrate them <strong>BEFORE</strong> the closure of automatic migration on June 15th, 2019.</p><p>We have also outlined this on our <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/tokenmigration/countdown/">documentation page</a> to help keep everything in one spot and ensure everyone is on the same page with migration.</p><p>The process of token migration thusfar has been a successful and relatively smooth one. The overwhelming majority of QRL ERC20 tokens have been migrated. There are only a few unmigrated tokens left, and hopefully, there will be hardly any left once automatic token migration closes.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ebc36409c050" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-june-4-10-ebc36409c050">Last Week in QRL June 4–10</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Trading for non-US customers will continue unchanged on the Bittrex International platform.</p><p>Full announcement can be read <a href="https://bittrex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028996652">here</a>.</p><p>Whilst we have no more information on this than has been released publicly by Bittrex, we support their efforts in evolving the cryptocurrency ecosystem and hope that their geofencing will be short-lived, especially as the open source QRL ecosystem is now mature and QRL is so widely distributed around the world.</p><p>In the last few days the QRL chain has grown past 500k blocks; a planned hard fork to bring on-chain decentralised governance, numerous iterative improvements and multi-signature wallet support is not far away. Mobile platform support, Keybase integration for identity proofs, and Ledger hardware wallet support have recently been added to the QRL, with Ledger X support, multi-tree support and Ledger Live integration right around the corner.</p><p>We are one of the few projects to take post-quantum security seriously and are proud that the entire ledger is already PQ-secure with a professionally audited codebase. Cryptocurrency should be impervious to technical attack and post-quantum insecurity remains a critical vulnerability in the armor of this nascent asset class.</p><p>Development progress aside, the near term priority for the project will be procuring an additional listing on a major Asian exchange as soon as is practical.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=b800494f0c6d" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/geofencing-of-crypto-assets-b800494f0c6d">Geofencing of Crypto Assets</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

That was also the time of the last big bitcoin bullrun, when, admittedly curious of the big gains people were making, I started to read about bitcoin and blockchain. The collision between quantum computing and blockchain was quite obvious to me, and the most serious and welcoming place to discuss those things was clearly the QRL community. I was particularly impressed by the Reddit posts by Jackalyst and Dezeyay, and a <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/quantum-computers-pose-a-credible-threat-to-the-security-of-bitcoin-4b1dd65944ca">Medium article by Charlie Thompson</a>.</blockquote><blockquote>I do not know if going through the 2018 bear market earns me a veteran medal, anyway I surely won a Basic Whining Token (1 BWT to me), as did many in the Discord server. It is clear now that the QRL community is steadily increasing its impact in the crypto discussion. I love being part of it, and am intrigued by the efforts the QRL team is making in favoring decentralization. The next months are crucial both for the progress of quantum computing and for the QRL building, I believe!</blockquote><p>Mquantum has been a member of the QRL community, as he states, since 2017.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Last Week in QRL May 28th — June 3rd</h3><p><em>Development Updates, Community Updates, Token Migration Reminder</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aUi4DIEPy6zXXUqbC5Fk1g.png" /></figure><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Last week saw our mobile wallets get out into the wider community, to wonderful reception. We truly appreciate all of the feedback, from praise to constructive criticism, and have taken it all into proper account as we move forward. This past week has us moving closer towards the closure of automatic token migration (more on this below), as well as the one year anniversary of our blockchain launch! Expect regular reminders about the closure of automatic migration both here, and on our other social channels, over the next 12 days.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LHGtskpMp3zdQywz_jjicw.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>go-qrl</strong>: Rate limiter added to Go QRL public API</li><li><strong>mobile: </strong>Roadmap agreed for mobile app v2 and v3/beyond</li><li><strong>node: </strong>Python node (master branch) now has additional API function of data directory size (i.e. chain size)</li></ul><h3>Community</h3><p>We will announce the winner of the Community Nomination for May in a separate blog, probably later in the week.</p><h3>Token Migration Reminder</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NXPaycjJv_7d4RGQBXoKrw.jpeg" /></figure><p><strong>AUTOMATIC TOKEN MIGRATION ENDS JUNE 15, 2019 2000 UTC (</strong><a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/tokenmigration/countdown/"><strong>Countdown</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p><p>As we announced back in April in a <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/automatic-qrl-token-migration-end-date-845f94e3f6d9">dedicated blog</a>, automatic migration will be closed as of <strong>JUNE 15, 2019 2000 UTC.</strong></p><p>This will <strong>not </strong>mark the complete removal of user’s ability to migrate ERC20’s. However, currently the process is <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/tokenmigration/countdown/#migration-steps"><strong>automatic</strong></a><strong> </strong>and can be completed in its entirety by the user on their own. After <strong>JUNE 15, 2019 2000 UTC</strong>, the process will be <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/tokenmigration/countdown/#steps-after-june-15th"><strong>manual</strong></a><strong>,</strong> require interacting with The QRL team in some capacity, and may take an <strong>indeterminate amount of time</strong>. <em>Additionally</em>, each manual migration will be evaluated on a <strong>case-by-case basis</strong>.</p><p>This cannot be stressed enough: every user with ERC20s remaining in their possession, <strong>please</strong> migrate them to main-network Quanta on the QRL blockchain as soon as it is reasonably possible for you to do so.</p><p>We have seen a wonderful showing from users so far, with the number of ERC20’s remaining dwindling by the day. Ensuring that as much of the token population is migrated before <strong>JUNE 15, 2019 2000 UTC </strong>is a priority for the team, so expect more reminders over the next 12 days as we advance towards the end of automatic migration.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d598ed1919c0" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-may-28th-june-3rd-d598ed1919c0">Last Week in QRL May 28th — June 3rd</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Given the decentralized, international, internet-based nature of cryptocurrency, it is no surprise that people want easy and secure access to their cryptocurrency wallets, wherever they are. That dream has now been realized in the form of the QRL mobile wallet.</p><p>At QRL, empowering our users is always on our mind, and a fast, functional mobile wallet interface is a necessary element in the pursuit of that goal. Today, we are happy to announce that the QRL Mobile Wallet is fully launched on both Android and iOS devices. You can find them on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/qrl-wallet/id1458620542?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Apple Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theqrl">Google Play Store</a>.</p><p>We cannot emphasize enough the hard work and dedication that Adem, our Mobile Developer, has put into these applications, and we are very thankful for him (you can go thank him yourself at his Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/ademcan_net">here</a>).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1013/1*gOnedxZdCA-hPfwcbN_HHA.png" /></figure><p>As the above images indicate, some of the functionality available to users of the mobile wallet include (but are not limited to):</p><ul><li>Offline wallet creation</li><li>Multiple wallet support</li><li>Send/Receive transactions</li><li>QR code integration</li></ul><p>A Few Notes:</p><ul><li>The QRL Mobile Wallet App is not available in China</li><li>The application may take some time to be added to the search indexes of the Google and Apple stores, respectively. However, you can access them via our links (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theqrl">Google</a>) (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/qrl-wallet/id1458620542?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Apple</a>), and they should appear in searches soon.</li></ul><p>Between the <a href="https://wallet.theqrl.org/">web wallet</a>, <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-wallet/releases/">desktop wallet</a>, <a href="https://shop.ledger.com/pages/ledger-live">Ledger integration</a>, and now the mobile wallet, there is a well-rounded variety of options for any given user to access their Quanta.</p><p>We are always looking to improve our current offerings, as well as to identify and pursue those things we have not yet considered. To that end, we are always appreciative of constructive feedback from our wonderful community of users.

More generally, the Consensus conference in NYC as well as some dynamic price action, has had the wider blockchain community aflutter with all sorts of proclamations and predictions. As ever, completing one task at QRL just leaves room to attack the next one. In the (relatively) near future we will be able to announce more fun utility added to the QRL ecosystem. For now, the best of what we can talk about is below.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gppZaKrYawY4Vgf0I_uJVg.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>qrl-ledger:</strong> Updating app (adding multitree support)</li><li><strong>block-explorer:</strong> Fix for Q/q in route on address page</li><li><strong>block-explorer: </strong>Bump explorer-helpers version</li></ul><h3>Token Migration Update</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wUksQw4Xu9i1NuyY2ZBRUw.jpeg" /></figure><p><strong>AUTOMATIC TOKEN MIGRATION ENDS JUNE 15, 2019 2000 UTC (</strong><a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/tokenmigration/countdown/"><strong>Countdown</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p><p>As we announced back in April in a <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/automatic-qrl-token-migration-end-date-845f94e3f6d9">dedicated blog</a>, automatic migration will be closed as of <strong>JUNE 15, 2019 2000 UTC. </strong>This will not mark the complete removal of user’s ability to migrate ERC20’s.
