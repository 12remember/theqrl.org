The testnet for Bromine, our first hard fork since the launch of the QRL mainnet, is now live! There is an entire blog dedicated to engaging with testnet <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/bromine-testnet-is-live-9bef2bd71ea">here</a>. In the world of Quantum Computing, IBM has been <a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/ibm-blockchain-cloud-revenue-jerry-cuomo/572037/">betting big on quantum cloud services</a>, and <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/02/26/d-wave-announces-leap-2-its-cloud-service-for-quantum-computing-applications/">D-Wave is getting into the cloud space</a> by announcing <a href="https://www.dwavesys.com/take-leap">Leap 2</a>, a cloud service that allows users to access a D-Wave 2000Q quantum computer.</p><p>After delaying the codefreeze initially scheduled for the 10th, we froze our code on February 21st, a new testnet was released on February 29th, and a test hard fork will occur at block height 10500, roughly the 7th of March. A release date for the actual hard fork will be announced once that is successfully completed. If there are issues, testnet will continue to run test hard forks until everything is stable. As always, we are committed to security and stability above all other concerns.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/468/1*lIx3BPGGfaTrqipEt2N4EA.png" /><figcaption>Credit: Discord user snannerb</figcaption></figure><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrandomx/commit/2da94de739ae722bb074ff22e2728504231807ec"><strong>qrandomx</strong></a>: Fix for pip3 install, by adding deps/RandomX into distribution package</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/integration_tests/commit/e40df2e825dc87579c8d481e320f1a8088dd76c0"><strong>integration_tests</strong></a>: Fixed location of genesis.yml for fork_recovery</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-docker-ci/commit/a4bccbc6fe6f5f497a2cafe6d3658601de3c3095"><strong>qrl-docker-ci</strong></a>: Fix yaml in circleci config</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrllib/commit/641ec32e7ff84dc10a07ed0f049321287113e3bc"><strong>qrllib</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Pullrequests/ademcan/master</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-cli/commit/262f8eaeb4bcb6ffe8b8c43e640cff966907a3e2"><strong>qrl-cli</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Bump handlebars from 4.1.2 to 4.7.3</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-wallet/commit/965a127f35dd90b8a100b9a93a41147bb2300a25"><strong>qrl-wallet</strong></a>: Add pre-HF testnet node hash</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/integration_tests/commit/5769881780c20e6af449d9f18dfed77d53beca40"><strong>integration_tests</strong></a>: Updated docker container to qrl-docker-ci</li></ul><h3>Bromine Hard Fork Testnet is Live!</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*EEvlZLlhfLTo7x8-uVpveA.png" /></figure><p>The Bromine hard fork is the first of its kind on the QRL network since our launch in June of 2018.

This is something that should be expected with any enterprise grade blockchain project.</p><p>With Bromine we’re looking to replicate that, with proper planning and forethought. Ensuring we have all the components (and checklists) in place for a successful migration.</p><p>Part of this has been <strong>documentation and developer support</strong>, some of which has been released already such as the <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/node/docker/">QRL Docker Node</a>.</p><p>While still in the early stages, the <strong>QRL Docker Node is slated to make launching a node and its related API’s, </strong>whether it’s mainnet <em>or</em> testnet,<strong> a repeatable and reliable process</strong> available on <strong>Windows, Linux </strong>and<strong> OSX</strong>.</p><h3>Project Mercury — Ephemeral Messaging System (EMS) SDK &amp; proof-of-concept code</h3><p>LatticeTX will be available in this upcoming hardfork, and with it comes the ability to <strong>launch your own fully post-quantum secure ephemeral messaging service using our SDK </strong>(Software Development Kit).</p><p>Along with this, one of the much requested components of bringing in developers is more proof of concept code. With that in mind, JP Lomas and Adem Bilican mocked up a <strong>proof-of-concept QRL Ephemeral Chat</strong> using the SDK over the last few days of the summit.</p><p>Code can be found on github: <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/ephemeral-chat-poc">https://github.com/theQRL/ephemeral-chat-poc</a></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/861/1*Mmi4skmxFOX5gpqQIRXVqQ.png" /></figure><p><strong><em>This is still very much a WIP</em></strong>, so when it’s ready to be pulled and played with, we’ll have a separate announcement which highlights different things you can do (hint: it’s not just chat applications).</p><h3>A new foundation Youtube channel</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oD4GDKw-EVWRdyC2-6Xh4A.png" /></figure><p>Starting fresh in 2020, Michael Strike has, in a phoenix like fashion, and in response to frequent community feedback (potential new trend?), founded a new* QRL youtube channel with a few initial videos and more on the way.</p><p>Already covered are videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0ETCcT3vGY">RandomX</a> (the mining algorithm QRL will be switching to), and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acHQGGuom7s">XMSS OTS key usage and best practices</a> with many more on the way.</p><p>Are there topics you’d like to see covered or are willing to cover/collaborate on?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>QIP 011 — Denomination ideograms for Quanta and Shor</h3><h4>Creative? Have a thought of what the denominations of QRL (Quanta, Shor) should look like? Lets see them!</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OAPFL1PNSbPS6r4oNA392A.png" /></figure><h3>Summary</h3><p>QRL Improvement Proposals (QIPS) can be used for a wide variety of things pertaining to QRL ecosystem which aren’t suited as github issues (which we <em>highly</em> appreciate and look forward to!). Usually, they’re technical in nature but they don’t need to be! This QIP is design related to improve the interaction and integration of QRL into various user facing interfaces and can be seen as an example on the flexibility of the QIP process.</p><p><em>It should be noted</em> that the seeds for this QIP evolved during discussions at our developer meetup in Amsterdam2020 that will still be going on as this blog hits the world wide web! Look forward to more on the fruits of our summit at a later date.</p><p>With that out of the way, for this QIP, <strong>we’re looking for two groups of people</strong>:</p><ol><li>Creatives to design different currency concepts for Quanta and Shor, our two denominations. Please continue reading to the end to better understand submission requirements!</li><li>People from all walks of life to act as private judges to evaluate whether a submission resembles like that of a currency. Interested? Please either message jackalyst on <a href="https://discord.gg/jBT6BEp">discord</a> or through email at jack@theqrl.org.</li></ol><h3>Motivation</h3><p>Ideograms are useful in conveying an idea or concept which is independent of any particular language.</p><p>Doing so as an SVG allows for usage in a wide variety of mediums. Further creating a webfont hosted either locally or from popular third-party services has the added advantage of being able to be easy to implement.</p><h3>Specification</h3><p>The reference asset format should follow the Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG v1.1) standard which has a wide userbase and can be incorporated into a font and hosted either locally and/or on third-party services.</p><p>This will be then compiled into the Web Open Font Format (woff) and Web Open Font Format 2 (woff2) standards.</p><p>In order to qualify whether a prospective ideogram is symbolic as a currency, it should be tested against a diverse background of people from different regions with a positive result being that it’s recognized as a currency.</p><p>For the test, every positive result can be recorded as 1 and negative as 0. These results would then be compiled and an average established with the final resulting floating point value between a 0 and 1. An overall result that’s greater than a value that’s to be determined through discussions will signify whether the ideogram works to represent a currency in a series of short-listing rounds.</p><h3>Backward compatibility</h3><p>Both SVG 1.1 and Woff/Woff2 are open standards and offer wide support.</p><h3>Implementation</h3><ol><li>Quanta and Shor ideograms should be uploaded, <em>separately</em>, as a gist in the SVG format and linked to in a comment as part of the comments-uri thread of this QIP: <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/pull/23">https://github.com/theQRL/qips/pull/23</a></li><li>A diverse team will be elected to do an initial round of testing as specified in the specification portion of this QIP with a process where the submitter of the ideogram wont be identified.</li><li>Ideograms would be short-listed and tested against a wider audience less familiar with QRL and short-listed further.</li><li>A vote would take place to identify favourite currency ideograms</li><li>The selected ideograms would be cleaned up and made into respective woff and woff2 files.</li></ol><h3>Anticipated common questions (ACQ!)</h3><p><strong>What values are Quanta and Shor?</strong></p><p>Quanta represents a whole value of QRL. As of today there’s 70,000,000 Quanta in circulation.</p><p>Shor is 1x10^-9 Quanta (0.000000001) and is the smallest unit of QRL.</p><p><strong>What if I don’t know how to use github, or a … gist?</strong></p><p>Feel free to ask in our support channel in discord for some help and if a team member doesn’t help out, we’re sure a member of the community can assist you. Github (and git) can seem scary, but it wont bite, promise.</p><p><strong>Why upload the ideograms separately?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Development Updates, Developer Summit, Hard Fork News</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8gRonUdQo1443PCCJBQ85A.png" /></figure><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Happy New Year! This marks the first blog in the new monthly format. We have switched to this format to allow for these blogs to contain more information, be more meaningful, and to make it easier to follow along with each and every blog.</p><p>Since our last entry, the holidays have come and gone, and already there has been news on the Quantum Computing front. IBM and Daimler have <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ibm-daimler-ces-2020-quantum-computer-solid-state-batteries-lithium-sulfur/">announced a partnership</a> to develop new lithium-sulfur batteries using quantum computers, <a href="https://phys.org/news/2020-01-advance-benchmark-quantum.html">new benchmarks for quantum computers</a> have been developed by researchers at the US Department of Energy, and <a href="https://www.eetimes.com/intel-cryogenic-chip-for-quantum-computing/">Intel has developed a new type of hardware chip</a> for quantum computers called Horse Ridge. 2020 has barely begun, and already it is looking like it will be a big year for quantum computing.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*z_DehZcA2vi3DwIPrtehCQ.jpeg" /><figcaption>Credit: Discord user Smith</figcaption></figure><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrandomx/commit/c9cac9e1c5f9d1ce260fc9605dbd4df947ade807">qrandomx</a>: Fix - Process all items on eventQueue to avoid deadlock</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/api.theqrl.org/commit/26111a862f70465c34a8235b8496abacaa988e74">api.theqrl.org</a>: API Patches (New API)</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/block-explorer/pull/331">block-explorer</a>: Use latest explorer-helpers module</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/explorer-helpers/commit/700dd2f29a298368869df50ae3692c30e07d4f5e">explorer-helpers</a>: build(deps): bump handlebars from 4.1.2 to 4.5.3</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-cli/commit/6b82388f8c506b4b624e7e9a591f4cf3c8a82784">qrl-cli</a>: feat: Add create-lattice and get-keys functions</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-wallet/commit/24aaf86ec33645bbf82b86750e6ac9c38830ed14">qrl-wallet</a>: Fix some UI issues and spend bug</li></ul><h3>Upcoming Amsterdam Dev Summit</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*eK6lo3akAk7DISzNU-CfQw.jpeg" /></figure><p>As many of you are aware, the developers for QRL will be meeting in Amsterdam this week to collaborate in person on the most important technical developments for the QRL network. Being able to work in the same place (to say nothing of the same timezone) can be invaluable to the development process. First in line for this particular summit is the upcoming hard fork — what is will contain (more on that below), implementation, optimization, and testing.</p><p>Look for more announcements regarding the developer summit and all it has accomplished once it has been completed.</p><h3>The Hard Fork</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-nNQCz8N12ry2Zr-hwI-pA.png" /></figure><p>While more information will come out regarding the hard fork on the other side of the developer summit, and as we approach the date of the fork, for now we can give you some of what will be included, as well as some information regarding the timing of the hard fork:</p><p><strong>Dates<br>CODE FREEZE: 10th February </strong><br><strong>RELEASE: 11th February <br>FORK DATE: 25th February — Block height TBA</strong></p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li>RandomX mining Algorithm</li><li>Multisig addresses &amp; transactions</li><li>LatticeTX (ephemeral messaging stub)</li></ul><p>There will be more information regarding the hard fork as we approach the dates for code freeze and ultimately, the fork itself. Watch this space as well as our <a href="http://@QRLedger">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/BheKAZb">Discord</a>, and our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/QRL/">subreddit</a> for more information.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=9ae87f253e7e" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-month-in-qrl-12-2019-1-2020-9ae87f253e7e">Last Month in QRL 12/2019–1/2020</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In practice this means that currently QRL is the only crypto asset using (soon to be) NIST-approved post-quantum cryptography.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=6f132be3e41c" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/first-post-quantum-cryptography-approval-from-nist-6f132be3e41c">First post-quantum cryptography approval from NIST..</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
