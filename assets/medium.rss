Halloween has come and gone. At QRL, we have continued to work towards providing our users with more reasonable liquidity options. Additionally, we have been continuing to develop, iterate and progress our own internal projects. We have had some inquiries into our <a href="https://angel.co/company/theqrl/jobs">golang developer and UI/UX developer positions</a>, and some initial interest expressed in our research grants. We will hopefully have more news on that shortly, but for now, the best of the rest is below.</p><p>We have spent the week in part playing with multi-signature wallets on devnet, which we still hope to bring to testnet in a reasonable timeframe. It is worth reiterating that multisignature wallet functionality will allow for more varied uses for our wallet, and will help provide a bedrock of functionality for later second-layer application development.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FwIeiNDdSUmyAgR9tzONKw.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/api.theqrl.org/commit/22589733e7417fea2e2717cee2b6c5eba68ed0c6"><strong>api.theqrl.org</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Fixes (<a href="https://github.com/theQRL/api.theqrl.org/pull/3">#3</a>)</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/js-api-bridge/commit/d8afed62ade219c6cd981fa77662f3ede42deadb"><strong>js-api-bridge</strong></a><strong>: </strong>TS -&gt; JS (babel) and a bit more…</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-cli/commit/fcc8f914c9bdcb534beaa59c1390641ca2c8086c"><strong>qrl-cli</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Adding descriptions to commands</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-wallet/commit/701fdc7350f2239e07310a7ec5af28b83ff4c5f5"><strong>qrl-wallet</strong></a><strong>: </strong>UX tweaks to wallet opening</li></ul><h3>QRL On SwapSpace</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vbjYert7rA-ZI1UPjZuOUg.png" /></figure><p>QRL has been added to <a href="https://swapspace.co/">SwapSpace</a>!

Not all weeks are created equal, and this week saw more activity than most. Externally, there was a large announcement that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20928294/google-quantum-supremacy-sycamore-computer-qubit-milestone">Google had confirmed its claims of Quantum Supremacy</a>. This luckily coincided with our intention to announce the launch of <a href="https://theqrl.org/research/grants/">our first batch of research grants</a>, and on Friday <a href="https://www.pr.com/press-release/797923">we did just that</a>; announcing that we were launching four research grants into the field of Lattice-based threshold cryptography.</p><p>Additionally, another podcast interview was recorded (look for that to drop in about a month). Internally, we released multi-signature wallets on devnet, which we hope to be able to bring to testnet in a reasonable timeframe. Multisignature functionality will allow for wider and more varied uses for our wallet, and will help provide more useful elements for later second-layer application development.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/511/1*MPxCNIsWHyBWOq3dGuhA0g.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/explorer-helpers/commit/ac088bfea6aea33a5883342ee84ee637ccb0905a"><strong>explorer-helpers</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Add support for multi_sig_create transaction type</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/theqrl.org/commit/78963970f17fed4e84315dfe083150a854c8053d"><strong>theqrl.org</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Add research grant</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/block-explorer/commit/3d197b7c1946d3700e0b0de7427e07729628c019"><strong>block-explorer</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Wallet address changed</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/wallet-helpers/commit/199f9e8b1cb59ae239d7984a34424f1bc6c17ce4"><strong>wallet-helpers</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Update handlebars version in development dependencies</li><li>Multi-signature wallets are now live on devnet! We hope to be rolling them out to the testnet as soon as it is ready.</li></ul><h3>QRL Research Grants</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/768/1*wIWG0qZhGrmTrRUqUY_W9g.jpeg" /></figure><p>As you can see on our <a href="https://theqrl.org/research/grants/">website</a>, we are now offering a Lattice-based threshold cryptography research grant with 4 positions. If you would like to apply for the research grant, please send all inquiries to hello@qrl.foundation. These grants represent an opportunity for QRL to help meaningfully advance not just the implementation of quantum resistant cryptography, but its exploration as well.</p><p>We recognize the role that we must play in this evolving niche of the blockchain world. As innovators on the cutting edge, it is incumbent upon us to help advance the technology both through supporting research, as well as through our own development efforts.</p><h3>New Exchange Listing — Vinex</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*21SQ2V05-0YalutBb4eeeQ.png" /></figure><p>As you possibly saw earlier today in our <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/new-exchange-listing-vinex-9d0fda0fbd61">previous blog</a>, QRL is now listed on <a href="https://vinex.network/">Vinex </a>on the <a href="https://vinex.network/market/BTC_QRL">QRL/BTC</a> and <a href="https://vinex.network/market/USDT_QRL">QRL/USDT</a> pairings. Vinex is a Singapore-based exchange, primarily targeted at the Vietnamese market, but also targeted at the entire ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) region. It also marks the first exchange to list a QRL/USDT pairing.</p><h3>Upbit Update</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/1*O1oJHaSTGlljxIabORBpKw.jpeg" /></figure><p>Today, Upbit <a href="https://sg.upbit.com/service_center/notice?id=2284">released a notice</a> of 20 BTC pairings that would be re-enabled on October 29th. Included in that list is QRL/BTC. Upbit also released the following caveats in regards to the 20 re-opening pairings:</p><ul><li>For safe trading and accurate market information, ask orders will not be available for initial 5 minutes.</li><li>Also, ask orders lower than 10% from the reference price will not be available.</li><li>Reference price refers to 1) closing price on SGD market or 2) closing price on Bittrex, previous day.</li><li>Market price could be volatile for initial period from listing. Please be careful when trading.</li></ul><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=bc6ee2aef86b" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-10-22-10-28-bc6ee2aef86b">Last Week in QRL 10/22–10/28</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In blockchain news, you can now get a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/you-can-now-get-a-masters-in-blockchain-from-a-school-in-where-else-malta">Master’s Degree in blockchain</a> from the <a href="https://www.um.edu.mt/dlt/masters">University of Malta</a>. It is pretty amazing to see how a technology that is barely over a decade old is already beginning to be integrated into academia. In technology, HTC has claimed to have developed the first <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/htcs-latest-blockchain-phone-can-run-a-full-bitcoin-node">smartphone to be able to run a full bitcoin node</a>, the Exodus 1s, allowing it to propagate transactions and blocks anywhere. Unveiling the device Saturday at the Lightning Conference in Berlin, the company claimed the new product is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/19/htc-launches-exodus-1s-a-cheaper-version-of-its-blockchain-smartphone.html">going to be priced at $244</a>, or about 1/3 its predecessor, the Exodus 1.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dP2N4vmnuJkG-n1bPKVeYg.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>validate-qrl-address:</strong> Add test cases for short addresses and bug fix</li><li><strong>theqrl.org:</strong> Images for markets</li><li><strong>block-explorer: </strong>Wallet address changed</li></ul><h3>September Community Nomination</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*s9yZ6J6XjxH863P5ThQuWA.png" /></figure><p>September’s QRL Community Nomination goes to Discord user ‘smith’, who has been an active and positive part of The QRL Contributors. He had this to say about how he found QRL and why he joined the community:</p><blockquote>Personally I am a security and privacy minded person and that has carried over to the crypto world. I started getting interested in crypto when Bitcoin was the cryptocurrency world, and I have watched the altcoins markets develop. There has been some forward thinking people in this space that considered the possibility that Quantum Computers might be a threat to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and that naturally got me interested in looking for good quality projects that where working to address that problem which lead me to QRL. I am a fan of the project and the community and hope to see it go from strength to strength.</blockquote><p>If you know someone that’s contributed to the QRL ecosystem who you’d like to nominate, you can do so by going to <a href="https://discord.gg/VR9kcs2">The QRL Discord</a> and nominating in the #butler channel.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ac2c1fb030aa" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-october-15-21-ac2c1fb030aa">Last Week in QRL October 15–21</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Last Week in QRL October 1–7</h3><p><em>Development Updates, Job Opening for Golang and UI/UX</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qwNSvuGWPEWevyGFOKCJ8g.png" /></figure><h3>Introduction</h3><p>We are now into the final quarter of 2019. Recently, quantum computing has been back in the news in a bigger way, with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02935-4">reports of increased levels of private investment in space</a>, as well as continued attention being paid by governments. We are also continuing to post job openings (more on this below), as we look to strategically grow the team ahead of our next development objectives. Finally, we will have the September Community Nomination recipient sometime later this week or next week.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fJuyiylFc6FOZsiBPJg5-w.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>qrl-wallet:</strong> UX tweaks to wallet opening</li><li><strong>theqrl.org:</strong> Remove unnecessary clutter from splash</li><li><strong>block-explorer: </strong>Wallet address changed</li></ul><h3>Call for Golang Developer, UI/UX Designer</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0AEyNpQM3HLQsrlz2jBd5A.jpeg" /></figure><p>As we have mentioned elsewhere, QRL is hiring three individuals for two specific positions (we are also separately searching for cryptographers interested in threshold lattice cryptography, for a grant we are developing) — UX/UI Designer, and Golang Developer(x2). You can see these <a href="https://angel.co/company/theqrl/jobs">job postings on angel.co</a>. We have received some interesting applications already, but want to cast as wide a net as possible to maximize the likelihood of finding the ideal candidate.</p><h4>Golang Developer</h4><p>From the <a href="https://angel.co/company/theqrl/jobs/638007-golang-developer">angel.co job posting</a>:</p><blockquote>If you’re interested but don’t fit every specification, don’t let that shy you away, it is a wish-list after all.</blockquote><blockquote>What you will do:<br>- Write industrial grade open source code that will be the backbone of a quantum resistant network.<br>- Work with a small, but growing team of talented developers and cryptography experts.<br>- Occasionally interact with the community in a polite and conductive manner.</blockquote><blockquote>What we wish you to be:<br>- You have a graduate degree or higher in computer science or affiliated field.<br>- You have written high-performance and concurrent applications.<br>- You are part of the QRL Community.<br>- You have p2p implementation experience.<br>- You are familiar with cryptography.<br>- You have a genuine desire to ensure all code is tested through writing unit and integration tests</blockquote><blockquote>Compensation<br>- Competitive based on capability and experience</blockquote><h4>UI/UX Designer</h4><p>From the <a href="https://angel.co/company/theqrl/jobs/307891-ux-ui-designer">angel.co job posting</a>:</p><blockquote>We are looking for someone to:<br>- Build a consistent brand identity and pleasurable user experience<br>- Explore ideas to improve the usability to our tools and apps<br>- Build upon corporate identity/image, color schemes, logo, layouts, visual identity</blockquote><blockquote>Your qualifications:<br>- BSc. degree in design/fine arts, related fields or experience in the area<br>- Minimum of 3yrs experience<br>- Experience in HTML/CSS, mobile applications<br>- Ideally experience in mobile hybrid frameworks such as Ionic, Framework7, etc.<br>- Previous experience with Android/iOS development.<br>- Some experience in software development is a plus.<br>- Critical thinking and able to work independently<br>- We appreciate if you can provide a portfolio of previous work.<br>- Language: English is critical</blockquote><blockquote>We offer:</blockquote><blockquote>- You will be a freelance contributor working remotely<br>- Very international team distributed around the world.<br>- Remote work and very flexible working times.<br>- Open source development, most of your work will be publicly recognized.<br>- We expect massive growth in the short/medium term.<br>- As an open source cryptocurrency project, you will receive payment in the cryptocurrency of your choice.</blockquote><h3>Community Nomination — September</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UnmlJxDvSBsLOXxfMx9MPQ.png" /></figure><p>We do not yet have the response ready from the QRL Community Nomination recipient for September.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Last Week in QRL: September 24th — 30th</h3><h4>Quantum supremacy coverage, development updates, and a call for cryptographers for grant(s) in threshold lattice cryptography.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/994/1*id4o3CQ7l4MRE9IlkXQ0Og.png" /></figure><p>There’s been a flurry of activity since NASA temporarily dropped a paper indicating of google reportedly achieving quantum supremacy.</p><p>From that we responded with a <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/quantum-supremacy-and-the-case-for-quantum-security-today-in-blockchain-390fe55daab5">piece reasserting our position that it’s not a matter of if but when quantum computers pose a threat, and that blockchains should be either already prepared or be preparing for a post-quantum world</a>.</p><p>This was a followup article to the <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/no-ibms-quantum-computer-won-t-break-bitcoin-but-we-should-be-prepared-for-one-that-can-cc3e178ebff0">previous one</a> when IBM announced a commercial quantum computer earlier this year in January.</p><p>If you’d like to know more about google’s achievement specifically, the best source is a blog from Scott Aaronson, who does a great job at breaking it down understandably for a high-school level audience. The blog is aptly called “<a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4317">Scott’s Supreme Quantum Supremacy FAQ!</a>”.</p><h3>Some coverage</h3><p>Needless to say, we’ve had some coverage, including a latest one where Coindesk and Adam Koltun connected in an article “<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/what-googles-quantum-supremacy-means-for-the-future-of-cryptocurrency">What Google’s ‘Quantum Supremacy’ Means for the Future of Cryptocurrency</a>”</p><p><strong>Other mentions include</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/google-quantum-supremacy-bitcoin/">Google Achieves “Quantum Supremacy”; is Bitcoin (BTC) Threatened?</a><br>- EthereumWorldNews</li><li><a href="https://decrypt.co/9642/what-google-quantum-computer-means-for-bitcoin">What Google’s quantum computer means for Bitcoin</a><br>- Decrypt</li><li><a href="https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2019/09/how-will-blockchains-battle-quantum-computing">How Will Blockchains Battle Quantum Computing</a><br>- Crypto Daily</li><li><a href="https://www.altcoinbuzz.io/crypto-news/blockchain-technology/does-google-threaten-cryptocurrencies/">Does Google Threaten Cryptocurrencies?</a><br>- Altcoin Buzz</li></ul><h3>Development updates</h3><p>Work continues to happen for the upcoming fork, (more on that in another blog). Outside of that there’s some small updates such as one to the wallet.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/643/1*qLb955qGcfDz-yRNfKV6Ig.gif" /></figure><p>It was reported from discord user Strike Attack that the wallet seed can be snatched from eavesdropping (think security cameras). This was quickly patched by JP Lomas in 24 hours with the current functionality shown in the above animated image.</p><h3>Call for cryptographers</h3><p>As part of our Foundations research arm, we’re putting out a call for cryptographers for a grant in threshold lattice cryptography.</p><p>More details will be released on that shortly.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=e09ccd5b88fa" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-september-24th-30th-e09ccd5b88fa">Last Week in QRL: September 24th —  30th</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*B-9gXEIyEmOglGtTq_MeBA.png" /></figure><p>The QRL mobile wallet <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/the-qrl-mobile-wallet-is-officially-launched-e3014dd79d8e">Version 1.0</a> was released in 5 months ago to the iOS and Android platforms as the first usable quantum-secure blockchain wallet. Needless to say, it was met with a positive response, and a flurry of suggestions.</p><p>Those suggestions were appreciated, and Adem Bilican has been hard at work bringing most of those suggestions to materialization. Below are the results of his labours.</p><p><strong>Before we get into that, for those that can’t wait to get started, you can get the </strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/qrl-wallet/id1458620542?ls=1"><strong>iOS</strong></a><strong> or </strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theqrl"><strong>Android</strong></a><strong> wallet at their respective stores.</strong></p><h3>Better wallet management</h3><p>Now you can set different names of wallets. Deleting a wallet has a better warning and asks for the PIN. Also corrected is the QR code generated on the wallet section.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qoBnBaKavGSo2wn9Qz3aLQ.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CbM90ui0EsEwp1FuR5X63w.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tnv16XferZFDDpkF66XT0g.png" /></figure><h3>More fine-tuned transactions</h3><p>You can now choose the OTS key index by just tapping the “OTS key index” in the send view. In addition to that the transaction details page has been refined to include more helpful information without having to view things in the external block explorer.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TjQLxily8fFyQwOqhmaU5A.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iCyd8O1cnvyUaHCO-QDtJQ.png" /></figure><h3>New: Settings page</h3><p>A new settings page will allow you to change the node (and port) to connect to. If anything but the default node is selected, a small warning icon is presented next to the settings menu to let you know that you know you’re not connecting to the default node. If there’s connection issues a message will be displayed on the transaction list page.</p><p>You can also turn on or off PIN security depending on your circumstances (it’s generally suggested to leave it on if in doubt!). If turned on, the app will always ask for the PIN when the user switches back to the wallet or if the application is left idle for more than 15 seconds.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1Uo5llHN4nFq3hVRrjQe-w.png" /></figure><h3>Better login/create page</h3><p>It’s now possible to open an existing wallet with a mnemonic. Previously, only the hexseed was supported, now you can open up an existing wallet with either the mnemonic or hexseed. This can be accessed from the login / create page, which can in turn be found when you’re adding a new wallet from the wallet management screen.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iYZWGa9wA7pqhuqBaMHj-A.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LRET8zMBLTeuoVkfTFJcRg.png" /></figure><h3>Other fixes</h3><ul><li>Date and Time are shown according to users’ general timezone preferences</li><li>Smoother and more responsive transitions between views</li><li>Additional UI/UX improvements</li></ul><h3>Version 3.0 and beyond</h3><p>With version 2.0 released, you may have some other feature request or change you’d like to see, or, you may have noticed that maybe your request didn’t make it into version 2.0.</p><p>First, check to see if your request isn’t already slated for version 3 and beyond by checking out github: <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/mobile-wallet/milestone/2">https://github.com/theQRL/mobile-wallet/milestone/2</a></p><p>If it’s not there, then feel free to make a request/bug report on the mobile wallet issues page: <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/mobile-wallet/issues/">https://github.com/theQRL/mobile-wallet/issues/</a></p><p>Finally, a big shoutout to the community members that graciously tested the mobile wallet, broke it, and made a bug report. Truly unsung heroes that don’t get thanked enough.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f854d95afbef" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/mobile-wallet-v2-0-f854d95afbef">Mobile Wallet v2.0</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
