            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Last Week in QRL August 20 — 26</h3><p><em>Development Updates, New Exchange Listing</em></p><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Over the course of last week, we saw QRL integrated into the CoinTiger trading platform. While we are still looking for more liquidity for our users, we are happy to have added another option at this time. We wrote a blog on it — you can check that out <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/cointiger-trading-is-live-today-ad65d741c3be">here</a>. This week was slightly lighter on development than most, as a few developers were out of town.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fJuyiylFc6FOZsiBPJg5-w.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>mobile-wallet:</strong> Beta release of v2</li><li><strong>theqrl.org: </strong>Search engine optimization — SEO</li></ul><h3>New Exchange Listing — CoinTiger</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8tI1WGxsPY-Xv3JW1zUD3Q.png" /></figure><p>CoinTiger is the latest exchange to list QRL, bringing the liquidity options for QRL users to <a href="https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-QRL">Bittrex</a>, <a href="https://upbit.com/exchange?code=CRIX.UPBIT.BTC-QRL">UpBit</a>, and <a href="https://www.cointiger.com/en-us/#/trade_pro?coin=qrl_btc">CoinTiger</a>. Deposits went live the 21st, Trading the 22nd, and Withdrawals on the 23rd. We want to assure users that we are not resting on our laurels — we are still looking for more liquidity options.</p><p>CoinTiger is based in Asia, and should afford users both within and outside of Asia a new opportunity to trade QRL should they desire. CoinTiger is a crypto-to-crypto exchange that offers pairs against their 3 base currencies — BTC, BitCNY, and USDT. Their website also comes in a variety of languages, including English, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Russian. We are excited to see what this additional market brings to the QRL ecosystem.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=142d9af2835f" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-august-20-26-142d9af2835f">Last Week in QRL August 20 — 26</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

As you can see on their <a href="https://medium.com/@cointiger/cointiger-will-list-quantum-resistant-ledger-qrl-at-16-00-on-22-8-2019-utc-8-100k-qrl-token-5335ad9816cf">Medium post</a> announcing the integration, and our <a href="https://twitter.com/QRLedger/status/1164458435330469888">subsequent tweet</a> at 8:00am UTC this morning, QRL is now live to be <a href="https://www.cointiger.com/en-us/#/trade_pro?coin=qrl_btc">traded on CoinTiger</a>. CoinTiger will be running a few promotions, including a trading competition, over the first week following the listing. You can find details on all that <a href="https://support.cointiger.one/hc/en-us/articles/360034680493-CoinTiger-Will-List-Quantum-Resistant-Ledger-QRL-at-16-00-on-22-8-2019-UTC-8-100K-QRL-Token-to-Give-Away-">here</a>.</p><p>Liquidity has always been seen by the QRL team as a necessary component for a healthy, functioning, low-friction ecosystem. We are also keenly aware that acquiring more liquidity options for our users has been one of the top discussed issues in our <a href="https://discord.gg/zbAJ9YV">Discord server</a>, as well as one of the top requested additions to the ecosystem across all our social media.</p><p>Speaking more generally, liquidity is a balancing act. If a given asset is available to be traded on many platforms, but those platforms themselves are largely distinct and unconnected from one another, then issues of low liquidity, an unrepresentative amount of volatility, and even arbitrage can occur. Conversely, to have all of one’s liquidity eggs in one basket may pool volume, but it obviously exposes an asset to the potential of having its liquidity massively affected should that singular exchange be hacked, or shut down. Even less extreme events, like if it were to change trading minimums, deposit/withdrawal minimums, and/or fee schedules can affect its trading environment.</p><p>We are all excited about this new liquidity opportunity for our users and would like to thank the CoinTiger team for its help in integration.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ad65d741c3be" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/cointiger-trading-is-live-today-ad65d741c3be">CoinTiger Trading is Live Today!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Development Updates, Ephemeral Messaging System, Tip Bot</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4vNUqueeRkGfLcKmui3B5Q.png" /></figure><h3>Introduction</h3><p>We are now almost through with the dog days of Summer (July 12 — August 20 this year). The team has had some very productive conversations around ways we can optimize some of our resources lately (such as SEO with the website). We are excited to implement some of these changes, and indeed the background work on many of them has already begun. Below is the best of what we can discuss from the past week at QRL.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ElH1TzAM8c0S2OegFB2XoQ.jpeg" /></figure><p>Note: It has been slightly more quiet a development week as many folks are on vacation, taking some well-earned rest during some of the hottest times of the year.</p><ul><li><strong>theqrl.org:</strong> Search engine optimization - SEO</li><li><strong>theqrl.org:</strong> Update papers.yml</li><li><strong>ephemeral:</strong> Final draft of EMS whitepaper</li></ul><h3>Ephemeral Messaging System — Whitepaper</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/922/1*DXhmyldlPrk7qK-cX-ERmQ.png" /></figure><p>As indicated above, the final draft of the Ephemeral Messaging System (EMS) whitepaper has been <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/ephemeral/blob/dc6165642a23e2cc3569d996a69edaba7461c88c/EMS_whitepaper_v1.pdf">posted to our GitHub</a>. We are very happy to see what the community thinks of it, and to continue to advance the EMS, which has been a feature we have wanted to add to the chain since its inception.</p><p>As a brief review, the Ephemeral Messaging System is meant to be a means by which QRL users can leverage the security of the network, while sending messages that are not themselves stored on the network (hence the name Ephemeral — which means “ lasting for a very short time”). We are very excited at the potential of EMS to meaningfully add utility to the QRL ecosystem.</p><h3>Tip Bot</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*de4c63Mfvyo0EeU2uS_9YQ.png" /></figure><p>Various bots have been under discussion since the earliest days of QRL as potential ways to both build out the functionality of the chain, as well as help connect the various elements of our online presence. A favorite topic of discussion has been a Tip Bot. We are happy to report that progress has been made on this front, with Discord, Reddit, and Twitter being identified as the initial 3 platforms on which it will operate.</p><p>Aside from that, there is always the helpful QRL Discord Butler-Bot (and his somewhat less useful but nonetheless entertaining 3rd party cohort, MathBot), which anyone who has spent time in the <a href="https://discord.gg/zbAJ9YV">QRL Discord</a> should be somewhat familiar with. I’d like to personally highlight the efforts of James (Fr1t2 on Discord) and <a href="https://medium.com/u/17213e804a43">Jack Matier</a> (Jackalyst on Discord) on the Tip Bot and Butler-Bot respectively — without them, we would not have achieved the progress on this front that we have.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=87e441bcc5e1" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-august-13-19-87e441bcc5e1">Last Week in QRL August 13–19</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

We have also updated the <a href="https://faqq.info/">FAQQ.info</a> (more information on that below), as we continue to try to fight ignorance surrounding the subject of quantum computing and blockchain technology.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jcQ1cHGTQ08md1POKyNN8Q.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>go-qrl: </strong>Fix - Disconnection caused by Fetch Block request from other peer</li><li><strong>docs.theqrl.org:</strong> Fixes to Node document and typo in Ledger Document</li><li><strong>qrl-cli: </strong>Adding descriptions to commands</li></ul><h3>FAQQ.info</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*w7E1HYE7wMjL50-tQ9CVrw.png" /></figure><p>One of the most productive contributions from the QRL community so far is <a href="https://faqq.info/">FAQQ.info </a>(Frequently Asked Quantum Questions). As its title implies, it is an FAQ for questions dealing with the intersection of quantum computing and blockchain. Given the unfortunate regularity with which we still continue to encounter otherwise educated individuals for whom quantum computing is a blind spot, FAQQ.info addresses a very real need in the market; education. The site has continued to be iterated upon, and has recently added information to a few sections, including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://faqq.info/bitcoin-has-plans-for-this/">Bitcoin has plans for this</a></li><li><a href="https://faqq.info/but-bitcoin-will-hardfork/">Bitcoin will hardfork</a></li><li><a href="https://faqq.info/but-bitcoin-will-softfork/">Bitcoin will softfork</a></li><li><a href="https://faqq.info/not-reusing-addresses-not-a-solution/">Reusing addresses</a></li><li><a href="https://faqq.info/quantum-computing-is-coming/">QC is far away</a></li><li><a href="https://faqq.info/quantum-computing-will-affect-bitcoin/">It’s going to affect Bitcoin</a></li><li><a href="https://faqq.info/what-about-banks/">What about the banks</a></li></ul><p>As always, you can track the changes made to the site on our <a href="https://github.com/theqrl-community/faqq/pull/2">QRL Community GitHub</a>.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=538368c2e141" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-august-6-12-538368c2e141">Last Week in QRL August 6–12</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Discussed was a wide variety of developer related topics from the next Hard fork, to PoS, to NIST Signature Schemes, and Ephemeral messaging. A full breakdown will be found in future blog(s), a <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/dev-meetings/blob/master/2019/08/03-04.md">few highlights of the development meeting</a> are below.</p><h4>Ephemeral messaging</h4><p>A draft of the Ephemeral Message paper was put together for circulation to a limited audience for feedback and review.</p><h4>Hard Fork status</h4><p><strong>The decision has been made to proceed with a hard fork following a code audit. </strong>This will allow the creation of the Ephemeral Message Layer applications.</p><p>In addition to this, the hard fork will include:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/pull/5">Deterministic addresses</a> (QIP003)</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/pull/7">Multisignature addresses</a> (QIP004)</li><li>On-chain voting/polls (QIP in draft)</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/pull/8">Extended message transaction functionality</a> (QIP005)</li></ul><p>Feedback is still welcome on many of these QIPS!</p><h4>Proof-of-Stake</h4><p>Future potential PoS schemes were discussed in detail with the evolution of our previous protocol. <strong>A separate PoS/EMS testnet will be created.</strong></p><p>Quantum Resistant Verifiable Random number Function (QR-VRF) research ongoing and undertaken in parallel with consensus algorithm implementation with XMSS. QR-VRF is important as at the heart of PoS is the ability to fairly choose ‘winners’ at random.</p><h4>Development roadmap</h4><p>Existing development roadmap reviewed. Core team expansion to facilitate new plans discussed.</p><p>Know golang? Get in touch at jobs@theqrl.org — full job description below. We’re initially seeking those inside the QRL community who are familiar with the project, however, will expand our search should candidates not be found.</p><p><strong>Job description</strong></p><p>We’re seeking two golang developers that think they’re able to fit the description below. If you’re interested but <em>don’t fit</em> every specification, don’t let that shy you away, it is a <em>wishlist</em> afterall.</p><p>What you will do:</p><ul><li>Write industrial grade open source code that will be the backbone of a quantum resistant network.</li><li>Occasionally interact with the community in a polite and conductive manner.</li></ul><p>What we wish you to be:</p><ul><li>You have a graduate degree or higher in computer science or affiliated field.</li><li>You have written high-performance and concurrent applications.</li><li>You have been part of the QRL Community for some time.</li><li>You have p2p implementation experience</li><li>You are familiar with cryptography</li><li>You have a genuine desire to ensure all code is tested through writing unit and integration tests Compensation</li></ul><p>Competitive based on capability and experience To apply, please send an email to jobs@theqrl.org</p><h4>More</h4><p>There’s more covered in the meeting summary over at github. <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/dev-meetings/blob/master/2019/08/03-04.md">Give it a read,</a> or wait for more content to be drafted and published on our blog.</p><h3>The July QRL community nomination award</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*emHST_KJ1CljJJEYUoMGHg.png" /></figure><p>July’s nomination goes to discord user ‘Strike Attack’, who has been instrumental and gone above and beyond in The QRL Contributors. He has this to say:</p><blockquote>I had first heard about a QC (Quantum Computer) in 1997 while speaking with a colleague. I found the concept fascinating. Conceptually, the theoretical premise of being able to harness the power of nature in order to perform a mathematical function felt visceral and compelling.</blockquote><blockquote>Several years ago, I started to become aware of the accelerating progress being made with quantum computers. After some research, it was not difficult to correlate an existential threat quantum computers presented to existing encryption with blockchain, which has been undergoing undeniable growth. From this, I began researching to see if anyone was addressing this problem ahead of time and came across the QRL Foundation in early 2018, of which a purpose-built solution was already in development. I found the team members professional, knowledgeable, and passionate about the project.</blockquote><p>As an extension to the above statement, he’s written a blog that outlines his full story about how he came to know about quantum computers and QRL in more detail.

While there’s a weekly meeting to talk with each other, meeting in person can increase the productivity of discourse <em>substantially</em>.</p><p>It is for this reason that The QRL developers are meeting for two days on the <strong>3rd and 4th of August </strong>(tomorrow as of this blog) to discuss the upcoming fork, consensus mechanisms (primarily proof-of-stake and its derivations), and other developer related topics.</p><h3>Those in attendance</h3><ul><li><strong>JP Lomas </strong><br>Core / Full stack developer</li><li><strong>Kaushal Kumar Singh</strong><br>Core developer</li><li><strong>Peter Waterland</strong><br>Core developer</li><li><strong>James Gordon </strong><br>Technical Writer</li><li><strong>Leon Groot Bruinderink</strong><br>PhD student Post-quantum Cryptographer</li></ul><h3>Topics of discussion</h3><p>The big highlight of this developer meetup is going to be the <strong>consensus protocol</strong>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Development Updates, Confirmed Exchange Listing, QRL Dev Summit next week</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vSRBIwa0NZwRtOk-EfXEAw.png" /></figure><h3>Introduction</h3><p>As July draws to a close, we are just one week away from the QRL Developer Summit. Pursuant to that, much of the past week has been spent in preparation for the summit, as well as working on securing additional liquidity (more on this below). We are happy to report progress on both fronts, and are very excited for the developments happening both within our platform and the more general QRL ecosystem in the near future.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gIGWGdPvBRJWdq8JiTq0QA.png" /></figure><ul><li><strong>block-explorer: </strong>Show keybase transactions in lasttx and unconfirmed tx views</li><li><strong>qrl-cli: </strong>adds WIP OTS command</li><li><strong>docs.theqrl.org: </strong>Fixes to Node document and typo in Ledger Document</li></ul><h3>Confirmed: Exchange Listing</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-TQV8Ji38KpZdDh_uYu3BA.jpeg" /><figcaption>Note: Image is not of the exchange</figcaption></figure><p>Liquidity is a necessary element for a fully healthy and largely frictionless ecosystem. We have heard concerns from the community about having limited markets available to trade Quanta, and we recognize those concerns. Given the at-times quickly shifting topography of the cryptocurrency exchange landscape, being wholly dependent on a single exchange for liquidity can be perilous.</p><p>We are therefore happy to report that there will be an announcement in the next few weeks regarding QRL being added to another exchange. While we cannot reveal the specific exchange or specific date at this time, we wanted to report the happy news as soon as we were able. Once we are able to go public with all the details, we will announce them on all our major social media platforms.</p><h3>Upcoming QRL Developer Summit</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*ERo4QWsYrEzATY9o1HS-vA.jpeg" /></figure><p>As mentioned in last week’s blog, later this week and into early next week, the QRL Developers will be gathering in Europe to work and discuss in person. With such an international project, stretching from North America to Europe to India to Australia, real-time collaboration can be a challenge. When we have digital meetings it is always early in the morning for some, very late at night for others. Understandably, that makes communication somewhat slower than it might otherwise be.</p><p>The QRL Developer Summit will allow our very talented developers to work at the same time, in the same place, and accomplish more in less time than usual. The main topic of the summit is Proof-of-Stake and its many manifestations. We will have more to report in the coming weeks (our very next blog will almost overlap with the summit so we may not be entirely ready to report then) regarding what is accomplished at the summit. Stay tuned — there will quite possibly be a blog wholly dedicated to it.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=941c2936f130" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-july-23-29-2019-941c2936f130">Last Week in QRL July 23–29, 2019</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Development Updates, Development Spotlight — Command Line Interface</em></p><h3>Introduction</h3><p>As we move into the final week of July, plans for the QRL developer summit in August have been largely laid out, with only the details remaining. As mentioned in the AMA and elsewhere, this gathering of the QRL developers will be focused on Proof-Of-Stake, and will occur in Europe in August. It represents the first time that all of the developers will be in one physical location, as well as the largest gathering of QRL team members to date. We will have more on what comes of that developer summit once it has come and gone. For now, here is some of what went on last week.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DQi6RXNonqobovCZNSbs3w.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>qrl-cli: </strong>fix: zip release assets</li><li><strong>go-qrl:</strong> Added lock before initializing Downloader</li><li><strong>QRL:</strong> Merged Dev</li></ul><h3>Development Spotlight — The QRL CLI</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/916/1*UwHBJMwLRaKWB_8RlSp8Ng.gif" /></figure><p>One of the many exciting developments being worked on by the talented team of QRL developers is the <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-cli">QRL Command Line Interface</a> (CLI). For the less technically inclined, a CLI is a text-based user interface used to view and/or manage computer files.</p><p>CLIs are an integral tool in the toolbox of a properly mature network. Not everybody wants to download a whole QRL node, or familiarize themselves with a node package manager or golang to be able to access the power of the <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/api.theqrl.org">QRL API</a> and ecosystem. In addition, there are environments in which it makes more sense to run commands in a self-contained fashion locally (network attached), and in the context of an advanced administrator to interoperate with other programs.</p><p>One example of a use-case would be an executable function to notarize documents on the QRL blockchain. More features are being added stage-by-stage, aiming to give access to the full suite of features of the platform by the time of public release.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=587cca5cb89c" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-july-16-22-587cca5cb89c">Last Week in QRL July 16–22</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Unfortunately, we cannot intimately discuss most of what those plans entail, aside from saying that we have taken in the feedback we have received of late, including the AMA, and are working to address much of it. Indeed, efforts were already underway in regards to some of the concerns, just not in a manner that we could explicitly disclose. The best of what we can discuss is below.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ElH1TzAM8c0S2OegFB2XoQ.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>mobile-wallet:</strong> Improvements for mobile wallet v2</li><li><strong>go-qrl:</strong> [MongoDB] Fix Transfer Token Transaction</li><li><strong>theqrl.org:</strong> Mention XMSS yields reusable addresses</li></ul><h3>The QRL Contributors</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*W97RMZ6AjIn5x6_UzzrOHg.jpeg" /></figure><p>The <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/the-qrl-contributors-ed7abd73ab1">QRL Contributors</a> consists primarily of roles, working groups, and projects. Like last week, we’d like to offer a glimpse into something from the server in today’s blog. Today we will be featuring a project, which are supposed to draw on one or multiple working groups to see them to their conclusion.</p><h4>Project: Tip Bot</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/543/1*3JjoFZrEnSWZyEQzUoXdjg.png" /></figure><p><strong>Scope</strong></p><p>Build a system that will interface with multiple social media platform API interfaces, to create a bridge to a working QRL node and wallet, allowing a user to send a tip to another user on the platform. The system should create a new address for a user even if they have not interacted with the bot. The bot would notify the user via DM that they have funds waiting and give clear instructions on how to withdraw.</p><p><strong>Main Goals</strong></p><ul><li>Allow users to tip</li><li>Stores multiple social media accounts to the same address for a single user</li><li>Allows the user to deposit and withdraw using social media platform</li><li>Reports stats to the user when requested ie: balance, total tipped, total received</li><li>Server that stores private keys should be secure and fully backed up. Bonus if somehow the data was stored on-chain and was able to be rebuilt upon catastrophe.</li><li>Web interface and domain to log into and interact with the bot to withdraw, deposit, check stats and tip users via Email?</li><li>Something similar to how keybase.io have integrated stellar to a keybase username. Allowing a user to tip via chat.</li></ul><p>We are very excited for when The QRL Contributors fully launches, as we believe it will make the path to supporting QRL clearer, to those who are interested.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=17a237a87d6a" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-july-8-15-17a237a87d6a">Last Week in QRL July 8–15</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
