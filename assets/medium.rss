            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>TL;DR — Who/What/Where/When/Why of Discover Blockchains Conference</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WBRSkJxuWD8UlCnUlQ7PQQ.png" /></figure><h3>Who</h3><p>Discover Blockchains 2018 will be attended by:</p><ul><li>Adam: Lead Business Strategist</li></ul><h3>What</h3><p>Discover Blockchains is a conference that is, like the name implies, meant to introduce new people to the blockchain industry, as well as show people already interested in blockchain something they have not seen before. I will have an <a href="https://discoverblockchains.com/agenda/#agenda">opportunity to speak</a> at the conference, and I will try to tailor my talk (as I always do) to the particular audience in attendance.</p><p>Given how often I still meet people when giving talks who come up to me afterwards to tell me that they did not know quantum computing was even possible, let alone being actively developed, I think I will be able to introduce the crowd to some new ideas. QRL is not sponsoring this conference so if you are planning to attend, we will not have a booth.</p><h3>Where</h3><p><a href="https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/texas/hyatt-regency-houston/hourh">Hyatt Regency Houston, TX</a></p><h3>When</h3><p>September 16, 2018</p><p>My talk will be at 3:00pm in the Imperial East room</p><h3>Why</h3><p>As I have stated in such blogs previously, one of the nice things about blockchain conferences is that they are not all the same. To be blunt, were this conference not in the United States, I doubt I would have been able to attend. However, given that adoption and education are still two of the largest barriers facing cryptocurrency in general, and QRL in particular, I am very glad to be able to take this opportunity to hopefully educate the audience about not only quantum computing and blockchain, but what QRL is doing about it.</p><p>Secondarily, it is nice to not have to lose days of travel to attend a conference, as by the end of my Spring gauntlet of speaking engagements, I realized I had lost altogether too much time in airports, on airplanes, and recovering from those two experiences.</p><p>As always, if you will be in attendance and would like to meet up for a chat, feel free to message me on Discord, Twitter, or send me an email.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=dab6e0b8651b" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/discover-blockchains-conference-next-week-dab6e0b8651b">Discover Blockchains Conference Next Week!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Project Update</h4><p><em>TLDR — x41 D-Sec audit has commenced, mobile wallet updates, wallet API improvements, OTC market opens, tipbots, and basic concepts videos</em></p><p>Our team is global, with members currently residing in The United States of America, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and India. There’s usually one person alive <em>and</em> awake every hour of the day, working on improving every aspect of this project.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/392/1*EhOqRFAO3PkLna9YzujHWg.png" /></figure><h4>x41 D-Sec — Our second Auditor after Red4Sec</h4><p>A foundational part of QRL is a sustained commitment to enterprise grade security and bringing on third party auditors.</p><p>Keeping in-line with this commitment, starting last <em>Monday</em>, the <a href="https://www.x41-dsec.de/">x41 D-Sec</a> team has begun an audit in earnest and is currently boring into our QRL code. This audit is shorter than our last at 2–3 weeks and covers the cryptography portion (ie XMSS) of our codebase, including Ledger code, and its implementation.</p><p>To give an idea of x41’s capabilities, some recent vulnerabilities discovered by x41 D-Sec involve <a href="https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/blog/smartcards/">smartcards</a>, <a href="https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/advisories/x41-2017-006-psftpd/">PSFTPd</a>, <a href="https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/blog/kernel_userspace/">Kernal Fuzzing in Userspace,</a> and <a href="https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/advisories/">more</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/592/1*BhOu6u5wiJlvbH0cAEzHNQ.gif" /></figure><h4>Mobile Wallet Views</h4><p>Recently we spoke about the core backend of the mobile wallet being complete and it’s just working on the views to ensure a slick experience.</p><p>Thus far the main view and backup view is complete, with only a few more key views remaining.</p><p>As a reminder, there will be both iOS and Android versions.</p><p>Like everything at QRL, this is under an MIT license and can be found on <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/mobile-wallet">Github</a>.</p><h4>Wallet Daemon API</h4><p>Further improvements have been made to our Wallet Daemon API which automates things like Slave Transactions so that exchanges can more easily integrate QRL.</p><h4>OTC Market on Discord Opens</h4><p>Until our mainnet coin is listed on an exchange, we have opened an OTC (Over the Counter) trading channel with the kind assistance of our Butler.</p><p>It should be emphasized that doing <em>any</em> OTC trading is at your own risk, however, much of this can be mitigated by selecting a trustworthy escrow (third party to hold both parties funds and release them upon agreement).</p><p>If you would like to take part in trading your Quanta, you can <a href="https://discord.gg/vqCwVqH">join</a> and do so today.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/536/1*UVxlRS2HOdrllPDYb0OwnQ.png" /></figure><h4>More Improvements</h4><p><strong>Tipbots and Faucets</strong></p><p>Work is being initiated on our tipbot and faucet. It’s still in the very early stages so if you have seen a faucet or tipbot that you like, let us know on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/qrl">Reddit</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/jBT6BEp">Discord</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/728/1*SpqBxGHiRkKsoCBRNoCfIw.png" /></figure><p><strong>Basic Concepts Videos</strong></p><p>Basics concepts videos would explain certain aspects of QRL to everyday folks.

It should be stressed that this is a <strong>work in progress</strong> and <strong>NOT TO BE USED IN PRODUCTION— ONLY FOR VIEWING PURPOSES</strong>.</p><h4>Project Carbon — Smart Contracts</h4><p>Continued work on the Smart Contract QIP (QRL Improvement Proposal), now dubbed <strong>Project Carbon</strong>, is well under way. Last week, attack surfaces were researched, discussed, and reflected in the upcoming QIP + blog. Along with this, compiler structure is making progress and is expected by this weekend.</p><p>There is a <em>strong</em> focus on balancing the functionality of our Smart Contract platform with preventing exploits. Feature wise, the emphasis is on financial applications, so expect things like Escrow Payments, Recurring Payment Schedules, decentralized automated multiple-signatory accounts, and more.</p><h4>Binary wallet v1.0.2 released</h4><p>An incremental update for our binary wallet for Windows, Mac and Linux has been <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-wallet/releases/tag/v1.0.2">released</a>!</p><p><strong>Changelog</strong></p><ul><li>Improved Mobile UI</li><li>Resolves transaction display bugs</li><li>Shows warning when sending to 0x Ethereum addresses</li><li>Updated CI to support CircleCI v2</li><li>Updated Meteor base to 1.7.0.4</li></ul><h4>Developer Meeting Summary</h4><p>Those with a keen watchful eye on our github may have already noticed the first release of our developer meeting summary. This summary will allow everyone to get an inside look on what is discussed every Thursday at 19:00 UTC.</p><p>Some highlights not mentioned in this blog are:</p><p><strong>BECH32 QIP</strong></p><ul><li>Planning parallel use of Q-hexstrings and BECH32 addresses</li><li>Andrew undertaking exploratory work</li></ul><p><strong>Interface/interaction</strong></p><ul><li>Early stage QIP on interaction design to visualise network activity discussed: primary draft on wallet in progress.</li><li>To be expanded both for explorer and smart contracts.</li><li>Outreach with interaction designers/interested parties in the crypto space discussed.</li></ul><p><strong>x41 audit</strong></p><ul><li>Audit to start Monday 20th August: scope and logistics discussed</li></ul><p>Be sure to read the full summary <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/dev-meetings/blob/master/2018/08/16.md">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>tldr; Ledger progress, mobile improvements, API documentation, our new post-quantum notarisation feature, and a brief update on smart contracts!</em></p><p>We have now surpassed our 44,000th block with no major issues, a testament to the amount of testing done by the development side at QRL. To date, nobody has locked up their funds (to our knowledge) on the QRL blockchain.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*x2IMle4WkmTOEXlYzXfBsA.gif" /><figcaption>Post Launch — Team at QRL HQ</figcaption></figure><p>With mainnet out of the way, many of us took alternating breaks, while a few others continued drumming on.</p><h4>Ledger Progress</h4><p>While the main codebase for the Ledger has been completed, there is now webwallet Ledger support for complete end-to-end support. This just needs to be reviewed by the Ledger team for full hardware support.</p><p>You can use the code yourself by heading to the respective repositories below, this comes of course with a caveat emptor (warning), test at your own risk!</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/ledger-qrl-js">theQRL/ledger-qrl-js</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/ledger-qrl">theQRL/ledger-qrl</a></li></ul><h4>Mobile Improvements</h4><p>Both the <a href="https://wallet.theqrl.org">webwallet</a> and the <a href="https://explorer.theqrl.org/">explorer</a> have had some adjustments to make everything work across all platforms, from desktop to mobile.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/413/1*G6DiQ7GQ8Xp2_xqbBNWheQ.gif" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/413/1*l6KaeT00quSag_RDdIYYbw.gif" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/413/1*txJj_moRTFuFlrU6vWrg0Q.gif" /></figure><h4>Post Quantum Resistant Document Notarisation</h4><p>After a successful launch, it’s time to start looking for the future! There will be a more blogs coming, that will go over what is on the horizon. In the meantime, it’s nice to build off of what we already have operational on QRL.</p><p>One of our first new features is Post Quantum Resistant Notarisation! For those that don’t know,<strong> Notarisation </strong>(British spelling)<strong> </strong>is the official fraud-deterrent process that assures the parties of a transaction that a document is authentic, and can be trusted. As you can imagine, this is a big thing in many industries. You can read more at <a href="https://www.nationalnotary.org/knowledge-center/about-notaries/what-is-notarization">national notary</a>.</p><p>You can try notarisation yourself <a href="https://wallet.theqrl.org">here</a> by going to our <a href="https://wallet.theqrl.org">webwallet</a> and selecting ‘Tools -&gt; Notarise Document’.</p><p>Don’t want to go through the whole process of notarising a document?</p><ol><li>Download a test document (<a href="https://cryptome.org/2016/01/CNSA-Suite-and-Quantum-Computing-FAQ.pdf">here</a>)</li><li>Go to the explorer <a href="https://explorer.theqrl.org/tx/9f2b01c3ed74cdeb7d5bffa4ed1b42bae4c2dfd91d15c94aef8f5589f11f711b">here</a>, select the file downloaded in step one, and click ‘Verify Notarisation’.</li></ol><p>There is more to come in this area to make it easier to use. Nice work Scott!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/540/1*7rhh3NxTQXg4oHHGkgS1rg.gif" /></figure><h4>Smart Contracts</h4><p>There has been some initial work with our smart contracts, which there will be a <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/QIPS/">QIP</a> of soon.</p><p>To avoid any potential compromisation of security we will limit the scope of smart contract code execution, and confine such code to fairly narrow logic statements. You can still do <em>almost </em>anything with such a design, but it makes for a much more secure system.</p><h4>QRL API documentation</h4><p>While we have had <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/">documentation</a> for various elements of our ecosystem up to this point, James has been hard at work with the API documentation, complete with examples on how to get started. The documentation is now live at <a href="https://api.theqrl.org">api.theqrl.org</a>. This is a major step in facilitating utility that will make it easier for developers, as well as outside organizations that may be interested, to build off our chain.</p><p>Now is the time to get started and head over to the <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/">qrl documentation site</a>, <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/node/QRLnode/">run a node</a>, and browse the <a href="https://discord.gg/KAg5fAm">#qrl-app-ideas</a> channel on our <a href="https://discord.gg/KAg5fAm">Discord</a> for ideas — or share one there yourself!</p><h4>Our road ahead</h4><p>As we get some final legal aspects sorted, and our main network coin listed on a known exchange, we have many exciting developments that we cannot wait to share with our users and the wider cryptocurrency community. Stay tuned!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f6cd800e0a63" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/step-by-step-what-weve-been-up-to-f6cd800e0a63">Step by step, what we’ve been up to</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>TL;DR — Red4Sec finished, more audits coming, and an update regarding mainnet</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*2_UP8IGhmeUbwSiaN6Gecw.png" /></figure><p><a href="https://red4sec.com/en">Red4Sec</a>, our auditor for the last 7 weeks, has completed their audit and submitted their report to QRL. Red4Sec consists of a talented team that has spent much of the past 2 months poring over our code 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. They were joined in parallel by our own team, also scouring our codebase for vulnerabilities and mishaps, as well as dealing with issues raised by Red4Sec as they came up.</p><p>During the analysis, whose report runs over 200 pages, a total of 67 vulnerabilities were detected. Many of these vulnerabilities did not pose any risk by themselves and therefore have been classified as informative.</p><p>All vulnerabilities were classified according to the impact level defined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerability_Scoring_System">CVSS</a> (Common Vulnerability Scoring System): critical, high, medium, low and informative.</p><p>A summary of the issues per project area is described below.</p><h3>What Red4Sec covered</h3><p>Red4Sec’s report was exhaustive, and covered the entirety of our project space, with the exception of our Post Quantum Cryptography, which will be covered by a further audit as it’s more specialized in nature. Below is a rundown of issues raised by Red4Sec by section of our network, as well as impact level.</p><h4>Blockchain</h4><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/QRL">QRL</a> (Python)<br><strong>Critical</strong>: 6 issues identified — All fixed by end of audit<br><strong>High</strong>: 3 issues identified — All fixed by end of audit<br><strong>Medium</strong>: 4 issues identified — 2 fixed by end of audit, outstanding fixes have now been applied (everything is fixed)<br><strong>Low/Informative</strong>: 21 issues or queries which have all been reviewed by the team, with changes made to the codebase where necessary.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qryptonight">Qryptonight</a> (C++)<br><strong>Critical</strong>: 1 issue identified — fixed by end of audit</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrllib">Qrllib</a> (C++)<br><strong>Informative</strong>: 1 issue which was closed by the end of the audit.</li></ul><h4>Public facing Infrastructure</h4><ul><li><a href="https://wallet.theqrl.org">QRL Wallet</a> (JS)<br><strong>Critical</strong>: 1 issue identified — fixed by end of audit<br><strong>High</strong>: 1 issue identified as informative by Red4Sec — the team rated it as High, however, and it was fixed by the end of the audit</li><li><a href="https://explorer.theqrl.org">Block Explorer</a> (JS)<br><strong>Low/Informative</strong>: 1 Low and 1 Informative level issue which were both closed by the end of the audit.</li><li><a href="http://theqrl.org">theqrl.org</a> (JS)<br><strong>Medium</strong>: 1 issue identified — fixed by the end of audit</li></ul><h4>Backend &amp; Team processes</h4><ul><li>Infrastructure includes nodes, cloud services, mail services and any other service that QRL relies upon for development and other team processes.<br><strong>Medium</strong>: 5 issues identified — all fixed by end of audit.<br><strong>Low/Informative</strong>: 11 issues have been identified and all have been fixed.</li></ul><h4>Some words from Red4Sec:</h4><blockquote>In general terms, it has been detected that the design and logic of the project is well defined.</blockquote><blockquote>The project code follows a methodology of safe programming and good practices. The project has great support from the team as some of the vulnerabilities have been resolved at the time they were detected by Red4Sec, mitigating the possible impact and repercussion that could cause to the project.</blockquote><p>The whole QRL team thanks Red4Sec for their professionalism and attention to detail in improving the quality of our ecosystem.</p><h3>More audits</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/256/1*KJ97NABMOdKXiBWnyINcEw.png" /></figure><p>As our codebase and ecosystem grows, it is important to continually appraise the security of our implementations.</p><p>We are, therefore, pleased to announce that we have signed an agreement with <a href="https://www.x41-dsec.de/">X41 D-Sec GmbH</a> to undertake a <em>secondary</em> security audit in the coming months. This audit will be differently focused than the Red4Sec audit, leveraging some of the specific expertise at X41 such as covering the Post Quantum Cryptography portion of QRL.</p><h3>Mainnet Progress Update</h3><p>It has been a long ride to reach our main network, and our launch is just the beginning of the overall QRL journey.</p><p>A date for the launch of the QRL main network has been finalized and will be announced in the coming days.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*wOpNyhey8Kogd6i88dfuoA.jpeg" /><figcaption>QRL On the Horizon — User art by Discord user @snannerb</figcaption></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=563ecfe04c75" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/red4sec-security-audit-concludes-a-summary-563ecfe04c75">Red4Sec security audit concludes; a summary</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been some time since our last general progress update blog. In this blog we will do our best to detail as much as we can regarding:</p><ul><li>The ongoing audit with Red4Sec</li><li>The creation of mobile wallets</li><li>Support for Ledger Nano S</li><li>Token burn update</li><li>Bug bounties</li><li>Transform PR</li><li>Conference/expo/meeting appearance summary</li><li>Mainnet plans</li></ul><p>This will likely be the last general update blog before the announcement of our main network, with smaller updates in the interim.</p><h3>The ongoing audit with Red4Sec</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/200/1*MgE-EIz1eOdKfzR32AW6FA.png" /><figcaption>Red4Sec logo</figcaption></figure><p>In the last week of April, our audit with <a href="https://red4sec.com/en">Red4Sec</a> (henceforth R4S) started, and we are happy to say that progress is steady and we can expect it to complete within the next 2–4 weeks. Over the past month, we have closed every issue on the private GitHub by R4S in a timely manner, as they have been raised. Fortunately, nothing thus far has been what we or Red4Sec would consider a critical vulnerability.</p><p>We are close to signing on our second audit partner, who will have a different focus on our repository than that which R4S is guided by. Mainnet launch will not be delayed for the conclusion of this audit.</p><p>We will have a separate blog discussing the audit once it has concluded. Moreover, we will be announcing information about the second auditor shortly.</p><h3>The creation of mobile wallets</h3><p>Our mobile wallet developer, Adem, has been hard at work (with the help of our designer, Luke Hahn) developing Android and iOS versions of a QRL wallet! We are happy to share some of the preliminary pictures of what the mobile wallets may ultimately look like:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/234/1*nVtplmj0cD-CZoZvcliC2w.gif" /><figcaption>Quick demo (low fps due to Medium filesize limits)</figcaption></figure><p>Due to the early nature of their development, no date can yet be made available regarding when these applications will be available to the general public. It should also be noted that design and UI elements may change between now and when the mobile wallets are launched. However, we can say that the mobile wallet should be operational within a reasonable time frame following the launch of our main network.</p><p>The repository for the iOS and Android version is <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/mobile-wallet">now available</a>.</p><h3><strong>Support for Ledger Nano S </strong>🎉</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/902/1*mQy3h4Xg2YQs_wh_LFrFJg.png" /><figcaption>Ledger generating private keys for a new wallet</figcaption></figure><p>We recognize that many of you have been patiently waiting for an update on this item in particular. Our developers have made great progress towards full Ledger support: we now have full wallet functionality inside a development environment. Due to computational limitations, the device takes about 45 minutes to generate a wallet. However, this only needs to be done once, and it only takes a few seconds to sign a transaction.</p><p>There is still some work to be done in order to make it ready for general consumers, but we cannot overstate the technical feat that has been accomplished here. From the outset, it was clear that it would be a difficult task to achieve functional Ledger support. We are very thankful to Juan for his tireless work in this regard, and to Leon for his invaluable technical advice and consult.</p><p>We will make more information available regarding Ledger support as development moves forward in this area. To be precise, we are at the point in time where the Ledger team is going to be reviewing our code. Pending approval, the code can and will be made available for public use on Ledger Nano S.</p><p>There is now a public repository for <em>some</em> (but not all) of the code related to the Ledger: <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-ledger-js">here</a>.</p><h3>Token burn update</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/821/1*or_uwJy9Z14oKco-rOrbxg.png" /></figure><p>The beginning of our token burn process was a big milestone towards the launch of our main network. We are able to provide an update on its progress: ~25% of QRL ERC20 tokens at large have been burned. <strong>If you’ve already burned your tokens, remember to keep track of that wallet file, and back it up on at least two separate devices!</strong> It is the <em>only </em>means by which you will able access your funds on the main network. <em>If you lose this file, the team can do nothing in order to return your funds to you, due to the very nature of blockchain technology. </em>Unlike other blockchains, a large quantum computer will not help you recover your coins on our network.</p><p>If you are reading this and would like to burn your tokens in order to have your wallet credited inside the genesis block, please read our <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/qrl-token-migration-begins-b0d5b53f697f">token migration blog</a>.</p><h3>Bug bounties</h3><p>Some time ago we announced a general plan to implement bug bounties. This was not forgotten. Thus far, we have fleshed out the framework of the program that we intend to use. It is now pending legal review in order to ensure that all participating parties are kept safe. Therefor it is likely that the official bounty program will be in place soon after mainnet launch.</p><h3>Transform PR</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/256/1*zla7a6BKBiIYrAzSc96siQ.png" /><figcaption>Transform Group logo</figcaption></figure><p>We’ve hired a PR agency to help bring our marketing and promotional efforts to a new level. You can read our blog post about it <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/we-hired-a-pr-firm-9ef9c19bb219">here</a>.</p><h3>Conference Appearances and Other Things</h3><p>In case you missed them: here are the <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-apac-blockchain-2018-1fbba71a50f">APAC</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-consensus-2018-ef1509897eec">Consensus</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-blockchain-expo-2018-83055106aae0">Blockchain Expo</a> blogs giving an overview of the various conferences and expos that we attended. Adam is currently in the process of identifying and coordinating conference, expo, and other visits of interest for the second half of 2018.</p><p>In addition, you can read up on the summaries of some of our meetings with <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-dc-finances-high-tech-family-office-meetings-b7fe8067d40d">DC Finance</a> and the <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-my-evening-with-the-financial-services-club-in-london-573d5713f001">Financial Services Club</a>. The networking made available to us through these is invaluable, and we are very thankful to have been allowed the privilege of presenting.</p><p>We will have a blog with a full or partial list of conference appearances in a few weeks, as new conferences are still being announced and communicated with.</p><h3>Mainnet plans</h3><p>This section is likely to be the most interesting part of the blog for most people. Now that we are nearing the conclusion of the pre-genesis development effort, our plans for launch can be made more clear.</p><p>One can expect us to launch a few weeks after the R4S audit has completed. On launch, the following will be immediately available within the Quantum Resistant Ledger ecosystem:</p><ul><li>The first fully quantum resistant cryptocurrency on its own main network.</li><li>Agnostic Cryptonight Proof-of-Work mining (<a href="https://getmonero.org/">Monero</a> mining compatible)</li><li>Post-genesis ERC20 QRL-to-mainnet migration tool</li><li>Quantum Resistant Tokens, also on the QRL network.</li><li>The web wallet, for easy interface with the QRL network.</li><li>Node documentation, in order to assist developers in their participation with this open source effort.</li><li>Public, audited node (including related) code available on GitHub</li></ul><p>In the future, after mainnet launch, the following will likely be made available, in no particular order:</p><ul><li>Ledger Nano S support</li><li>Bug bounty program</li><li>Ephemeral messaging layer</li><li>Android and iOS mobile wallets</li><li>Proof of Stake</li></ul><p>Some things that we have in mind for the future:</p><ul><li>Smart contract feasibility evaluation immediately following mainnet</li></ul><p>We understand that many of our supporters would have liked to see some of these features at launch. However, due to time constraints and an acute understanding that a quarter of all tokens at large (and rising) are currently locked into migration, certain non-critical features had to be pushed back.</p><p>Regarding exchange support for our main network: per instruction, we cannot discuss whether or not any given exchange listing our ERC20 token will or will not convert automatically those ERC20 tokens to our mainnet QRL. Please look to those exchanges for notice in regard to these matters.</p><p>We are also in talks with new exchanges about listing our mainnet QRL coin. Exchange support information will be made available as soon as we are free to share it.</p><p>In conclusion: it is reasonable to expect us to launch in the weeks following the conclusion of both the R4S audit and the CryptoValley conference.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=80c7dbe89ac0" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/pre-genesis-project-update-80c7dbe89ac0">Pre-Genesis Project Update</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>TL;DR — We hired TransformPR, a cryptocurrency/blockchain focused PR firm that is going to help us meaningfully advance our marketing efforts</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/164/1*bODUyD0j7gvZPy_0lmKoeg.png" /></figure><p>QRL is excited to announce that we have hired TransformPR as our PR firm of choice to help us through our next stage as we continue to grow as a project. TransformPR has been in the blockchain/cryptocurrency space since 2013 and currently its clients represent about 31% of the total cryptocurrency marketcap. The documents were signed last week, and we are happy to say that work is already underway, and a number of exciting placements are coming up in the next few weeks.</p><p>With offices in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Paris, Cape Town, and a global headquarters in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Transform is perfectly situated to help QRL expand globally and maximize the impact of our message.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/528/1*_-MCWYq_Q7-pu7KtssFGng.png" /></figure><p>TransformPR has represented more than 200 companies, organizations and projects in the blockchain space, and has helped more than 80 token crowdsales and scaling campaigns, including Aeternity, Augur, Bancor, Bittrex, Counterparty, Dash, Ethereum, Factom, Golem Network, Gnosis, Kraken, Lisk, Rivetz, SALT Lending, ShapeShift, Storj, Syscoin, and WAX.</p><p>Transform is led by Michael Terpin, Founder and CEO, who has more than 25 years of PR agency management. Michael directly supervised many PR campaigns of the digital media era, including early-stage PR for America Online, Earthlink, Jupiter, Motley Fool, Match.com, and Shapeways, as well as full-service campaigns for AT&amp;T, Fujitsu, JBL, Konami, Marriott, Memorex, Philips, Rackspace, and TEAC.</p><p>We are excited for how Transform will help us reach out into more non-endemic outlets and spaces, as well as help us cut through the noise inside the ever-more-crowded blockchain/cryptocurrency space.</p><p>On a personal note, I am overjoyed to have them on board as it will allow me to focus more on <em>creating</em> content and determining forward-looking strategy, and less time chasing after reporters and outlets trying to <em>place </em>said content. Transform has already lined up a number of placements and interviews, some of the traditional sort, and some of a more colloquial variety (podcast, etc).</p><p>Everyone should look forward to seeing those placements come to light in the next few weeks, and going forward expect a stronger press presence for QRL in all of its endeavors.</p><p>TransformPR — welcome to the team!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=9ef9c19bb219" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/we-hired-a-pr-firm-9ef9c19bb219">We Hired A PR Firm!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>TL;DR — Flew to London to speak to the Financial Services Club, met many people in unique FinTech positions, figuring out the second half of 2018</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/668/1*-Oqaf4bcxnjSJUtb786ufw.jpeg" /></figure><p>Last week, I had the opportunity to fly to London to give a presentation to The <a href="http://www.fsclub.net/">Financial Services Club</a>. This was made possible by <a href="https://thefinanser.com/">Chris Skinner</a> — author of over a dozen books, including his most recent accomplishment, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Human-Revolution-Humanity-Everyone/dp/9814794376">Digital Human — The Fourth Revolution of Humanity Includes Everyone</a>” which has been well received both critically and commercially. Chris reached out to us on Twitter initially, which then spiraled into a more general conversation that ended with me agreeing to present to a group of FSC members.</p><p>The Financial Services Club bills itself as, “The number ONE networking group for senior executives in financial services in Europe” and has chapters in England, Ireland, Scotland, Poland, Norway, Sweden and Austria. From my experience that night, I can certainly confirm that if one was interested in networking opportunities in the financial services sector, then I would think the assembled talent that I saw would be very appealing indeed.</p><p>I spoke to a selection of FSC members at the historic <a href="https://www.paintershall.co.uk/">Painter’s Hall</a> in London. As an American, it is always impressive to be able to walk through halls that are older than my country, and it was truly pleasant to be able to have a thoughtful, thorough discussion about forward-looking tech in the midst of such storied history.</p><p>Part of the appeal of such gatherings is that there is an element of intimacy and privacy attached to them — as such I will not be divulging any personal details of any of the attendees, and will instead keep things more circumspect as it relates to the members of The Financial Services Club. They were kind enough to invite me into their space, so I will try to respect theirs.</p><p>The evening was structured fairly normally, with a brief informal period for introductions and drinks in an adjacent room, followed by moving into the main hall for the presentation, Questions &amp; Answers, and then moving back to the adjacent room for more conversation and drinking for about an hour. My presentation took a little under an hour, with another half hour or so being used for Q&amp;A.</p><p>Both the host and chair for the evening were extremely gracious in introducing me both to many of the members in attendance, as well as before my presentation. By the quality and quantity of questions and comments following the presentation, I believe it was a success. Certainly, vigorous applause is something one likes to receive at the end of talks. However, while applause is a sign of a good talk, engaged and attentive audience members asking quality questions during the Q&amp;A is the hallmark of a great one. Some questions were more challenging than others, but all that revealed was the amount of knowledge assembled in the room, as well as what active listeners the FSC members were.</p><p>Generally it is a good sign when there is so much post-presentation conversation as to run over the allotted commingling time. I ended up heading to a pub with 4–5 of the attendees after the event, where we continued a more general discussion of Cryptocurrency, Blockchain, and where both are headed for the next few hours over a few rounds of drinks.</p><p>One of the things I have been most fortunate to experience in my time with QRL is such a diversity of audiences for my presentations/talks. The perspectives of blockchain developers, family office managers, exposition hopefuls, conference attendees and in this case of FSC — current and former executives in the financial services industry, some of which had taken a career pivot into the tech sphere.</p><p>I am a firm believer that anyone stuck in an echo chamber loses their sense of perspective. It is always important to remember that one of the strengths of cryptocurrency and blockchain is that these technologies appeal to many different people on many different levels, but it can be easy to lose sight of that.</p><p>Blockchain is not one thing, and it is not even necessarily one thing primarily. Blockchain is many things, to many people, and one of the most important things I have learned in this space is that the only way to learn what it is Blockchain means to all these diverse subsets of people is to go out and meet them, talk with them, and hear their perspectives.</p><p>I can honestly say that my evening in London with the Financial Services Club has been one of the most unique, and interesting, experiences I have had in this space. It provided me with opinions and points of view that I (and I would imagine, most people) do not often hear in person, articulated by people with the knowledge and experience to leave no doubt as to the sincerity of their words.</p><p>Thank you to The Financial Services Club, Thank you to Painter’s Hall, and Thank you to Chris Skinner for making this all possible.</p><h3>Second Half of 2018</h3><p>As I mentioned in my last blog, we at QRL are still figuring out what our conference attendance will look like for the second half of 2018. Got a conference worth attending? Send me an email at adam@theqrl.org.</p><p>We hope to have a preliminary internal list of conferences produced within the next week or so, with outreach occurring immediately afterward. Securing sponsorships and the like can take time, but stay tuned, we should hopefully have that settled in a month or so.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=573d5713f001" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-my-evening-with-the-financial-services-club-in-london-573d5713f001">Reflecting on my evening with the Financial Services Club in London</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
