            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Development Updates, QIP 010 — Quanta emission change</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4btE0CL_8j1lxHSP7olcmQ.png" /></figure><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Another week, another new QIP. With the second new QIP in as many weeks, we see another QIP that is targeted at the mining side of the blockchain. While more details are below, it is worth noting that changing the mining algorithm (as was proposed in QIP 009), or changing the emission schedule, as with QIP 010, are both fundamental changes to the blockchain that will likely require substantial debate and testing before any potential implementation.</p><p>We will also soon be asking for testers for multisignature wallets on testnet. If you have any interest, please feel free to reach out to myself (Puck342 on Discord) or Jack (Jackalyst on Discord) with interest.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*4MJCD9OZqdufiNuy98_I_g.jpeg" /><figcaption>Credit: Discord user Smith</figcaption></figure><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-cli/commit/fcc8f914c9bdcb534beaa59c1390641ca2c8086c"><strong>qrl-cli</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Adding descriptions to commands</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/docs.theqrl.org/commit/251095a3d7e9826cecadce6cf4c3e4aab3812b1f"><strong>docs.theqrl.org</strong></a>: Fixes to Node document and typo in Ledger Document</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrandomx/commit/2bca2fe13eeffe5227a05e18e167fa4ae236ea73"><strong>qrandomx</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Updated Swig Interface to expose ThreadedQRandomX instead of QRandomX</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-wallet/commit/093119ef0d9697fd6541bea0402476a751181dd0"><strong>qrl-wallet</strong></a>: Add v1.1.15 to recognized versions</li></ul><h3>QIP 010: Quanta emission change to 2 Quanta per minute</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*usz5t3QLTvc62eSvcBvZVg.jpeg" /></figure><p>Recently, GitHub user <a href="https://github.com/Ottslayer">Ottslayer </a>proposed <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/pull/21">QIP 010</a> — Quanta emission change to 2 Quanta per minute. Here is what he wrote:</p><blockquote>Emission is currently close to 6 Quanta per minute and will be exponentially reduced to 0 in approximately 200 years. Reducing the emission to 2 Quanta per minute will reduce the availability of Quanta.</blockquote><blockquote>Lower emission rate will most likely increase demand of Quanta, the price, and people who are willing to point their mining rigs to qrl which will enlarge the network.</blockquote><p>As of this writing, there are seven comments from four users on the QIP. The mining algorithm and emission schedule are two of the pillars upon which any blockchain is built upon. Change to either (or both) of these will probably have an effect on the relative desirability of mining a given chain, and as such can have direct effects on its hashrate and relative security, as well as its popularity in the mining community. It is therefore quite interesting that the last two QIPs have both dealt with these issues (QIP 009 being related to the mining algorithm).</p><p>As always, we would highly encourage any community members with opinions to voice them on the <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/pull/21">GitHub page for QIP 010</a>. However, given the nature of the proposal, we would especially encourage anyone who is currently mining QRL, or who has experience mining in general, to weigh in as to how you feel the proposed changes would (or would not) affect the current mining situation for QRL. As always, we are deeply appreciative of the involvement of our community members, and there is no better way to get involved than creating and/or commenting on a QIP.</p><p>Remember — anyone can submit a QIP on GitHub. Have a great idea for QRL? <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips">Submit a QIP</a>!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=9d2438ae52e" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-november-12-18-9d2438ae52e">Last Week in QRL November 12–18</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It is worth reiterating that multisignature wallet functionality will allow for more varied uses for our wallet, and will help provide functionality for second-layer application development moving forward.</p><p>Additionally, it is always exciting whenever we are able to add passionate and talented individuals to the QRL team. We are happy to announce that Michael Strike (Discord user StrikeAttack) has joined the QRL team! We have a blurb from Michael and more on what he will be doing below.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*urUBIFDA6rrLGHfXfrLQKw.png" /><figcaption>Credit: Discord user snannerb</figcaption></figure><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/explorer-helpers/commit/a21273c9bebb88ce38a682803681925b16b5a020"><strong>explorer-helpers</strong></a>: Parse multi_sig_address from Buffer</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-wallet/commit/093119ef0d9697fd6541bea0402476a751181dd0"><strong>qrl-wallet</strong></a>: Add v1.1.15 to recognised versions</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/theqrl.org/commit/7a399a885303e30b71f36ec94b7c716418ad9e49"><strong>theqrl.org</strong></a>: Google fonts + Update blog</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/QRL/commit/130044cb5015ad21db49a3b6867f1327a071b680"><strong>QRL</strong></a>: Fixes and updated integration tests</li></ul><h3>QIP 009: Change mining algorithm to RandomX</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ojnxSRHZ041dgcsy_IFtyw.jpeg" /></figure><p>Four days ago, GitHub User <a href="https://github.com/doctor-gonzo">doctor-gonzo</a> submitted QIP 009: Change mining algorithm to RandomX. Here is what he had to say (via <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/pull/20">GitHub</a>):</p><blockquote>A mining algo change would go a long way towards re-vitalizing the mining community. Many people built rigs or pointed rigs at QRL initially but have been crushed by ASICs / FPGAs and no longer participate.</blockquote><p>As of this writing, 8 different individuals have weighed in on the QIP, including 3 QRL team members (<a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/pull/20">link</a> to comments). Mining (for those chains that utilize PoW) forms the bedrock of operationality for a blockchain, and any changes to it will almost certainly have a ripple effect. That also means that inaction can be as dangerous as action, as an untenable situation can have a corrosive effect on the health of a blockchain network. As such, it is important to take such discussions very seriously, and the more good-faith participants in the discussion, the better.</p><h3>Introducing Michael Strike</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bo0FMUqghvvsUxA6ttL2Kw.jpeg" /><figcaption>Pictured: Michael Strike</figcaption></figure><p>Many of you already know Michael Strike (Discord user StrikeAttack) from his activity on the <a href="https://discord.gg/VR9kcs2">QRL Discord</a>. An active community member for more than a year now, over time Michael’s involvement with the project grew. Recently, we have asked him to join us on the community/advocacy side of QRL. He will help us continue to optimize and grow our efforts to help raise the profile of the project, as well as continuing to help set us apart within the crowded blockchain space.</p><p>Some words from Michael:</p><blockquote>It is with great excitement that I have accepted a role with QRL as a core team member. I’ve been involved with the project since before mainnet, and getting to know the community and core team members has been personally rewarding. While I will be wearing many hats in this role which will likely change over time, I can share a few ideas up front. First, I intend to aggressively, professionally, and tactfully reach out to people of influence, organizations, and government agencies in order to expedite community awareness of our project so that we will be more strategically positioned in the future. Second, I also believe that establishing a solid brand identity is critical to the future success of this project. Third, I plan to develop media content and look for strategic areas of process improvement that will streamline efficiency. I have a strong, vested, and passionate interest in the success of this project and am looking forward to contributing the best that I can. Thank you.</blockquote><p>Once again we would like to extend a heartfelt welcome to Michael from the entire QRL team and community — we are certain that he will be an excellent addition to QRL!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/498/1*-JhzEhEYTcoG9SAF19ChZg.gif" /></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=9a7aa79de773" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-11-5-11-11-9a7aa79de773">Last Week in QRL 11/5–11/11</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

We have had some inquiries into our <a href="https://angel.co/company/theqrl/jobs">golang developer and UI/UX developer positions</a>, and some initial interest expressed in our research grants. We will hopefully have more news on that shortly, but for now, the best of the rest is below.</p><p>We have spent the week in part playing with multi-signature wallets on devnet, which we still hope to bring to testnet in a reasonable timeframe.

Not all weeks are created equal, and this week saw more activity than most. Externally, there was a large announcement that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20928294/google-quantum-supremacy-sycamore-computer-qubit-milestone">Google had confirmed its claims of Quantum Supremacy</a>. This luckily coincided with our intention to announce the launch of <a href="https://theqrl.org/research/grants/">our first batch of research grants</a>, and on Friday <a href="https://www.pr.com/press-release/797923">we did just that</a>; announcing that we were launching four research grants into the field of Lattice-based threshold cryptography.</p><p>Additionally, another podcast interview was recorded (look for that to drop in about a month). Internally, we released multi-signature wallets on devnet, which we hope to be able to bring to testnet in a reasonable timeframe. Multisignature functionality will allow for wider and more varied uses for our wallet, and will help provide more useful elements for later second-layer application development.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/511/1*MPxCNIsWHyBWOq3dGuhA0g.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/explorer-helpers/commit/ac088bfea6aea33a5883342ee84ee637ccb0905a"><strong>explorer-helpers</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Add support for multi_sig_create transaction type</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/theqrl.org/commit/78963970f17fed4e84315dfe083150a854c8053d"><strong>theqrl.org</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Add research grant</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/block-explorer/commit/3d197b7c1946d3700e0b0de7427e07729628c019"><strong>block-explorer</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Wallet address changed</li><li><a href="https://github.com/theQRL/wallet-helpers/commit/199f9e8b1cb59ae239d7984a34424f1bc6c17ce4"><strong>wallet-helpers</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Update handlebars version in development dependencies</li><li>Multi-signature wallets are now live on devnet!

In blockchain news, you can now get a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/you-can-now-get-a-masters-in-blockchain-from-a-school-in-where-else-malta">Master’s Degree in blockchain</a> from the <a href="https://www.um.edu.mt/dlt/masters">University of Malta</a>. It is pretty amazing to see how a technology that is barely over a decade old is already beginning to be integrated into academia. In technology, HTC has claimed to have developed the first <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/htcs-latest-blockchain-phone-can-run-a-full-bitcoin-node">smartphone to be able to run a full bitcoin node</a>, the Exodus 1s, allowing it to propagate transactions and blocks anywhere. Unveiling the device Saturday at the Lightning Conference in Berlin, the company claimed the new product is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/19/htc-launches-exodus-1s-a-cheaper-version-of-its-blockchain-smartphone.html">going to be priced at $244</a>, or about 1/3 its predecessor, the Exodus 1.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dP2N4vmnuJkG-n1bPKVeYg.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>validate-qrl-address:</strong> Add test cases for short addresses and bug fix</li><li><strong>theqrl.org:</strong> Images for markets</li><li><strong>block-explorer: </strong>Wallet address changed</li></ul><h3>September Community Nomination</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*s9yZ6J6XjxH863P5ThQuWA.png" /></figure><p>September’s QRL Community Nomination goes to Discord user ‘smith’, who has been an active and positive part of The QRL Contributors. He had this to say about how he found QRL and why he joined the community:</p><blockquote>Personally I am a security and privacy minded person and that has carried over to the crypto world. I started getting interested in crypto when Bitcoin was the cryptocurrency world, and I have watched the altcoins markets develop. There has been some forward thinking people in this space that considered the possibility that Quantum Computers might be a threat to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and that naturally got me interested in looking for good quality projects that where working to address that problem which lead me to QRL. I am a fan of the project and the community and hope to see it go from strength to strength.</blockquote><p>If you know someone that’s contributed to the QRL ecosystem who you’d like to nominate, you can do so by going to <a href="https://discord.gg/VR9kcs2">The QRL Discord</a> and nominating in the #butler channel.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ac2c1fb030aa" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-october-15-21-ac2c1fb030aa">Last Week in QRL October 15–21</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The blog is aptly called “<a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4317">Scott’s Supreme Quantum Supremacy FAQ!</a>”.</p><h3>Some coverage</h3><p>Needless to say, we’ve had some coverage, including a latest one where Coindesk and Adam Koltun connected in an article “<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/what-googles-quantum-supremacy-means-for-the-future-of-cryptocurrency">What Google’s ‘Quantum Supremacy’ Means for the Future of Cryptocurrency</a>”</p><p><strong>Other mentions include</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/google-quantum-supremacy-bitcoin/">Google Achieves “Quantum Supremacy”; is Bitcoin (BTC) Threatened?</a><br>- EthereumWorldNews</li><li><a href="https://decrypt.co/9642/what-google-quantum-computer-means-for-bitcoin">What Google’s quantum computer means for Bitcoin</a><br>- Decrypt</li><li><a href="https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2019/09/how-will-blockchains-battle-quantum-computing">How Will Blockchains Battle Quantum Computing</a><br>- Crypto Daily</li><li><a href="https://www.altcoinbuzz.io/crypto-news/blockchain-technology/does-google-threaten-cryptocurrencies/">Does Google Threaten Cryptocurrencies?</a><br>- Altcoin Buzz</li></ul><h3>Development updates</h3><p>Work continues to happen for the upcoming fork, (more on that in another blog). Outside of that there’s some small updates such as one to the wallet.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/643/1*qLb955qGcfDz-yRNfKV6Ig.gif" /></figure><p>It was reported from discord user Strike Attack that the wallet seed can be snatched from eavesdropping (think security cameras). This was quickly patched by JP Lomas in 24 hours with the current functionality shown in the above animated image.</p><h3>Call for cryptographers</h3><p>As part of our Foundations research arm, we’re putting out a call for cryptographers for a grant in threshold lattice cryptography.</p><p>More details will be released on that shortly.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=e09ccd5b88fa" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-september-24th-30th-e09ccd5b88fa">Last Week in QRL: September 24th —  30th</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
