In addition to this there has been the usual development efforts as well as some research into more forward-looking opportunities. As always, the best of what we can talk about is below.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nHS7PWvsegTG5qbGCrTDKQ.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>QRL Block Explorer:</strong> Change to OTS Tracker colors to make them less harsh</li><li><strong>theqrl.org: </strong>Have the down arrow actually go somewhere (H/T to discord user <a href="https://github.com/kuantum">@kuantum</a>#1776 for reporting this error)</li><li><strong>Explorer-helpers: </strong>Fix keybase signature hash display</li></ul><h3>QIP 008: Ephemeral Message Format Proposal</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bnwfORWLZwEHiWConYSRZQ.jpeg" /></figure><p>Barely a week out from the last <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips">QRL Improvement Proposal (QIP)</a>, and the next one arrives — we can only hope for more weeks with as many ideas coming to the fore as this one. Authored by Peter Waterland (<a href="https://github.com/surg0r">GitHub</a>) and Kaushal Singh (<a href="https://github.com/cyyber">GitHub</a>), here is the abstract:</p><blockquote>To extend functionality of the QRL beyond the ledger an off-chain network messaging system known as ‘ephemeral’ is proposed. These lifespan-limited internode broadcast messages may be relayed and stored optionally by agreeable qrl-nodes.</blockquote><blockquote>A simple initial format with some DDOS protection is suggested, allowing custom implementations from users or applications wishing to interact with the QRL ledger/network.</blockquote><p>The full text of the QIP can be found <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/blob/master/2.Proposals/1.%20Open/8%20-%20Ephemeral%20Message%20Format%20Proposal/8%20-%20ephemeral%20message%20format%20proposal.md">here</a>. As always, we highly encourage anyone who is interested to go look at the discussion already occurring on GitHub, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/pull/17">here</a>. Alternatively, there is always an appetite for discussion on our <a href="https://discord.gg/VR9kcs2">Discord</a> server. There will also be a blog specifically on the new QIP at a later date.</p><p>It has been almost 6 months to the day since the first QIP was published. We are currently tracking at a bit over 1 QIP per month, with the interval between QIPs shrinking over time. This is exactly the sort of feedback we were hoping for when creating the QIP system. It is one thing to make systems, it is entirely another thing to see those systems be put to proper and good use. Thank you to everyone who has submitted a QIP, commented on one, or simply discussed them.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=a623b2024959" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-april-23-29-a623b2024959">Last Week in QRL April 23–29</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>An introduction to the newest QIP</em></p><p>On April 19th, GitHub user <a href="https://github.com/IMac318">IMac318</a> submitted the latest QRL Improvement Proposal (QIP) — “QIP-007: Support Tokenization of Securities.” (<a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/tree/master/2.Proposals/1.%20Open/7%20-%20Support%20Tokenization%20of%20Securities">link to QIP</a>) We are always excited to see new QIPs pop up on GitHub, especially when they originate from within our community of users. Certainly, tokenization of securities is an issue that is being debated in various iterations throughout the blockchain world. Security tokens generally, and Security Token Offerings (STOs) more specifically, have risen to the forefront of many debates regarding the next wave of functionality to hit the blockchain ecosystem.</p><p>This blog will provide a general overview of the QIP, but you should feel free to check out our <a href="https://theqrl.org/protocol-updates/">QIP section of the website</a>, or jump in on the conversation <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/pull/15">directly on GitHub</a>.</p><h3>Abstract</h3><blockquote>One of the biggest potential use cases of blockchains in the future is the tokenization of existing securities to be bought and sold by valid parties. Being the only existing blockchain that is quantum resistant from genesis and adding the functionality of smart contracts, QRL is in a unique spot to capitalize on this opportunity. The QRL team should evaluate whether the functionality of the smart contracts that are currently in progress can support the tokenization of securities on the QRL blockchain. If that is not the case, the team should consider adding additional functionality that allows for such tokenization.</blockquote><h3>Motivation</h3><p>Given the length of the motivation statement, I have only included 2 of the paragraphs below, with a link to the full text at the bottom.</p><blockquote>The current usefulness of blockchain is highly debated, and there is much conversation about what “killer app” will eventually drive adoption. One current use of blockchain is speculation, and it is very attractive in this area due to the ability to buy fractions of a coin or token. In contrast, many traditional assets require the purchase of an integer number of the asset. For example, it is difficult to obtain a fraction of a stock or real estate property…</blockquote><blockquote>The purpose of this QIP is to urge the QRL team to evaluate whether or not the in-progress smart-contract functionality can support the creation and exchange of security tokens. QRL smart contracts are limited in functionality compared to ETH (where security token standards are currently being created), so the author does not automatically assume that such functionality currently exists. If it does not, consideration should be given to add such functionality.</blockquote><p>Full text <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/pull/15/commits/4c0d57f7445252e0dcf9db578c948e5ed5c754a5#diff-6ca84c8a1de35376f47274be3c33c93c">here</a></p><h3>Specification</h3><blockquote>QRL already has the ability to create tokens, but to be compliant with regulations, it must be possible to restrict transactions of security tokens between wallets if the sending and receiving wallets do not meet certain criteria (example: <a href="https://thesecuritytokenstandard.org/);">https://thesecuritytokenstandard.org/);</a> therefore, it would have to be possible to make these checks before a token transaction is admitted to the blockchain.</blockquote><h3>Implementation</h3><blockquote>Several entities are working on platforms for tokenization of securities. Polymath, Harbor, Securrency, and tZero are prominent examples. It may be worth reaching out to them for evaluation and implementation.</blockquote><p>We continue to be very proud of the QIP system and are grateful for how the community has thus far embraced it. We hope to continue to see new, interesting and timely QIPs pop up intermittently as time goes on. Hopefully, they will help shape and direct development of the QRL network in such a way that will allow the network to be the best it can be.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d885e8d9aedc" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/qip-007-support-tokenization-of-securities-d885e8d9aedc">QIP-007: Support Tokenization of Securities</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

So far we have <a href="https://discord.gg/qFU3AGW">Russian</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/AcSjhug">Spanish</a> channels, with more to come in the following weeks.</p><p>While this is presently landlocked to Discord, the full intent is that it will eventually reach beyond that, to most social media platforms.</p><h4>Contributors</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/884/1*YedlovyTwfSINRvLuMCdyg.png" /></figure><p>You may have noticed our latest major site update included a contributors section — but not all contributors write code. Some of the best contributions to the QRL ecosystem have come in the form of artwork, the written word, constructive feedback, and outreach. While we’ve recognized these contributors in the form of <em>nominations</em>, we wanted the opportunity to highlight them in another way.</p><p>In addition to that, there’s been a small group of people working behind the scenes, doing an amazing job helping us bring the project to a wider audience. The discussions have been fruitful, and allowed us to access a distilled perspective, from those who are truly passionate about the network.</p><p>These things have been in motion for some time, but we will be able to say more publicly in the coming weeks. Stay tuned!</p><h3>Developments</h3><h4>Testing for GO-QRL</h4><p>Internal testing has commenced for GO-QRL. In the coming weeks, this will go out to #TestPilots — including some documentation and a call for more public testing!</p><h4>Final stages of the mobile wallet</h4><p>We’re on the cusp of a release — as soon as we get Apple’s approval. We know many have been waiting for this to happen, as it completes our ecosystem of front-line products.</p><h4>QIP-007: Support Tokenization of Securities</h4><p>IMac has put together a QRL Improvement Proposal (QIP) for the tokenization of securities.</p><blockquote><strong>Abstract</strong></blockquote><blockquote>One of the biggest potential use cases of blockchains in the future is the tokenization of existing securities to be bought and sold by valid parties.

Much like the changes in the natural world, some of the upcoming updates and evolution at QRL are already visible, some are just around the corner, and some are still further off towards the horizon. We will continue to keep you updated with blogs like this one, so tune in each week to see what has been going on (that we can talk about) at QRL.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UDxH03pjgrssTBvdt0ldlA.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>theqrl.org:</strong> Improve QIP ingest + QIPs update</li><li><strong>MongoDB:</strong> Additional state and transaction data for explorer v2</li><li><strong>Multisig: </strong>Send and vote transactions complete</li><li><strong>Multisig: </strong>Test node deployed</li></ul><h3>Website Update</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8ujihDyR2jmzU_PkJnjEhw.png" /></figure><p>As mentioned in a <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-march-12-18-2019-4e5c48d32651">previous “Last Week in QRL” blog</a> — we have and will continue to be updating the website. Some changes have been made internally and are merely waiting to be pushed to the website, while others are still being worked on.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/193/1*_lmLZqe7KHNkFF-34G00Mw.png" /><figcaption>New Getting Started dropdown</figcaption></figure><p>One such change is pictured above. We will be expanding the “Getting Started” section of the website to include a drop-down menu with a variety of links to various resources for a new user. Whatever someone is interested in doing with the network or coin, they can find their path(s) here.</p><p>As with all changes to the user experience, feedback is appreciated. We have already seen some very useful and constructive feedback to some of the changes we have pushed to the website, and we are very thankful for it. One of the strengths of our community has always been the passion present within it, and constructive feedback is a wonderful manifestation of this passion.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/961/1*yByZaav-CdoDTnBm1MaApg.png" /></figure><p>One such area where we received feedback was our team of core contributors. We had removed the specific section highlighting them, in favor of a more holistic list of our top open source contributors on GitHub. The top contributors list still features all of the core contributors, though it does not highlight them. We received feedback from numerous sources that the more expanded list of contributors was good, while also receiving feedback that the loss of the highlighted core contributors list left things unclear. As a result of that feedback, we have reinstated the <a href="https://theqrl.org/team/">team of core contributors</a> page.</p><p>We hope you continue to send in your feedback, as we continue to push updates live to the website moving forward. As always, we are happy to receive feedback on out <a href="https://github.com/theQRL">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/HTJsBgr">Discord</a>, or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/QRL/">Reddit</a>.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=2bb96cd9510b" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-april-2-8-2bb96cd9510b">Last Week in QRL April 2–8</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>TL;DR — We are launched! The QRL network is one week old. Brief overview of media coverage, and a few words on what comes next</em></p><h3>Taking The First Step</h3><p>To paraphrase J. R. R. Tolkien, “It’s a dangerous business, going out your door. You step onto the road, and there’s no knowing where you might be swept off to.” Our launch was that stepping out our front door, onto a road that may lead us to any number of destinations. Such is the nature of product development, even more so when one is developing an open-source network. Once an open-source network is launched and out in the world, it can never really be said to be the sole property of any given team, even the team that created it. Somewhat similar to sending a child off to university, we do wonder what interesting styles and new pieces of flair our network might pick up out there in the wide world, but ultimately we are proud as parents of how far we have come.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*-hpTwPBdIofrkUJrmFDHKQ.jpeg" /><figcaption>Emotional state of the QRL team during launch</figcaption></figure><h3>We Launched!</h3><p>On the morning of June 26th, 2018 The Quantum Resistant Ledger launched its blockchain network. The moment we had all been working towards, and that our community has been patiently (and occasionally not-so-patiently) waiting for, had arrived. After ensuring the initial stability of the network, we opened it up to the public and to our delight, people began, almost immediately, to mine, create tokens and transfer value on the network.</p><p>It was a year’s worth of work, a group of individuals (a fellowship, if you will), coming together from different backgrounds to try and bring about a solution to a potentially existential problem facing our communal space. Despite some trials and tribulations, we fought on, making tough choices when necessary, but ultimately delivering our prize.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*gpJXbgrYLGGofjqj_5gwGw.jpeg" /><figcaption>The QRL Team, after a long road to a successful launch</figcaption></figure><p>We are happy to announce that there have been no major network outages, network collapses, 51% attacks, or significant periods of time without a block. All of the major mining pools that have taken to our network have reported smooth sailing. We have responded to every support ticket, and without fail have either alleviated the issue raised, or helped in its eventual conclusion. This would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of the entire team, and it has been a pleasure to see their commitment to the project.</p><h3>In The Media</h3><p>We were delighted to see media outlets cover our launch, both with organic coverage and via our press release. Here are some of the articles that covered our launch:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.chipin.com/quantum-resistant-ledger-launches-new-blockchain-network/">Quantum Resistant Ledger Launches New Blockchain Network</a> — Chipin</li><li><a href="https://thisweekincrypto.co/quantum-resistant-ledger-launches-new-blockchain-network/">Quantum Resistant Ledger Launches New Blockchain Network</a> — This Week In Crypto</li><li><a href="https://cryptocoremedia.com/qrl-quantum-resistant-ledger-mainnet-has-arrived/">Quantum Resistant Ledger Mainnet Has Arrived</a> — Crypto Core Media</li><li><a href="https://blocktribune.com/new-blockchain-claims-it-is-resistant-to-quantum-computing-attacks/">New Blockchain Claims It Is Resistant To Quantum Computing Attacks</a> — BlockTribune</li><li><a href="https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2018/06/27/quantum-resistant-ledger-launches-new-blockchain-network/">Quantum Resistant Ledger Launches New Blockchain Network</a> — CryptoNinjas</li><li><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/qrl-foundation-claims-its-new-blockchain-can-defy-quantum-computing-attacks/">QRL Foundation Claims Its New Blockchain Can Defy Quantum Computing Attacks</a> — NewsBTC</li><li><a href="https://edgylabs.com/whats-the-quantum-resistant-ledger-according-to-adam-koltun">Quantum Resistant Ledger COuld Make Current Blockchain Models Obsolete</a> — EdgyLabs</li><li><a href="https://www.the-blockchain.com/2018/06/29/qrl-launches-quantum-resistant-blockchain/?utm_campaign=BCN%20Twitter&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitter">QRL Launches Quantum Resistant Blockchain </a>— BlockchainNews</li><li><a href="https://altcointoday.com/can-a-new-blockchain-counter-the-quantum-computing-threat/">Can A New Blockchain Counter The Quantum Computing Threat</a> — AltcoinToday</li></ul><h3>Coming Up</h3><p>Over the next handful of weeks, look for more information regarding our additional audits, the role the QRL Foundation will be undertaking, as well as more on our evolving roadmap and what is in store next for our network. We are very glad to those of you who have been with us from the beginning, and happy to meet the new people joining our community every day. As I have said before, everything up to the actual launch of our network was preamble.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=cf7fb47f0c" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/the-start-of-a-journey-cf7fb47f0c">The Start of a Journey</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Last Week in QRL March 26 — April 1</h3><p><em>What went on last week</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tEy81NY-zdCuXROPuRmIWw.png" /></figure><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Today is April Fool’s Day in those parts of the world that celebrate the holiday. This blog will be free of hoaxes and practical jokes, however. This past week at QRL saw</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bE4JAmqL83F6QKTWM8tBNQ.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>Block-explorer: </strong>Fix search box on mobile</li><li><strong>api.theqrl.org: </strong>3 minor fixes</li><li><strong>docs.theqrl.org: </strong>Remove dev notice for QRL Ledger Application</li></ul><h3>QIP 6: Implement dPoW</h3><p>Recently, QRL user “Machin” on Discord created a <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips">QRL Improvement Proposal (QIP)</a> on GitHub —<a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/blob/master/1.Ideas/qip-000/6%20Implement%20dPoW.md"> QIP 6: Implement dPoW</a>. As always, we highly encourage everyone to go read the QIPs in full for themselves. Here is the abstract:</p><blockquote>Purpose of this QIP is to implement a dPoW mechanism to strengthen QRL protection against attacks like 51%</blockquote><p>We are very excited to see another QIP on the GitHub, even more so because this one was originated wholly from a community member. We see the greatest potential for the QIP system when QIPs are not coming exclusively or primarily from the team, but rather the community. By continuing to decentralize elements of development, even indirect ones like a QIP, the general QRL ecosystem is strengthened. Hopefully, QIPs will pop up in these blogs much more regularly moving forward.</p><h3>Community</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6QS7rKSOVnrHoZDU5wp0ew.png" /></figure><p>We are happy to announce that Discord user Machin is March’s QRL Community Nomination Winner! We asked Machin to tell us a bit about themselves and their relationship to the QRL:</p><blockquote>I am a French UX Designer with a technical background, working for a Telco company. I started to get interested in crypto and blockchain towards the end of 2015, and I bought a few ETH at the beginning of 2016. I really start to spend more time to understand the overall crypto world only in mid-2017, when I decided to diversify my portfolio. A part of my research was to understand risks of this technology. Thanks to my understanding of computer security, the first idea which came to me was the quantum computer threat.</blockquote><blockquote>I started to look for a crypto solution which could address that risk. The only project I found with a real ambition on this subject was QRL. This was in June 2017. Then I contributed to the QRL project during summer 2017 by providing some VPS to the dev team for a few months. In addition, I wrote some technical documentation to explain how to install and manage a QRL node on a Raspberry pi. I really appreciated being able to work with Kaushal/Cyyber during this period. Also, I would have liked to have been able to help out more on the UX Design but unfortunately, I did not have enough spare time to do it.</blockquote><blockquote>I must admit that my motivation and rate of contribution lessened when the team decided to move to PoW. But I kept an eye on the project and I was very happy to see that the team manage to develop the Ledger App. I decided to initiate a QIP after recent discussions regarding risk of 51% attacks. I would hope the dev team and overall QRL community works to find the best solution to mitigate the risk until a long-term solution is found.</blockquote><p>As always, we <em>highly </em>encourage anyone with interest to submit a QIP. It remains one of the most direct ways to contribute to the QRL ecosystem, as well as the most direct way to make your desires regarding the continued development of QRL known.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=1494c781829e" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-march-26-april-1-1494c781829e">Last Week in QRL March 26 — April 1</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>TL;DR — QRL has and will continue to evaluate its communication strategy and overall structure to best address the needs of the project as they continue to evolve.</em></p><h3>Communication</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/498/1*C5d6GQeQIANKC7YbsNK7Cw.png" /><figcaption>A:“Can you hear me?” B:“I can see you!”</figcaption></figure><p>Communication, broadly, is the imparting of data from one or more parties to another. Humanity&#39;s ability to communicate in a highly specific, wildly diverse manner is one of the things that has accelerated the evolutionary development of our species. Blockchain has revolutionary implications in various areas of our lives, and it is perhaps at its most revolutionary when it comes to data, and imparting it from one party to another.</p><p>When it comes to software development, communication is something of a new curiosity. When a car company unveils their new vehicle to be released the following year, the car is already built. When a company unveils its new app or service, to be launched in a few weeks/months, it is probably built, or at least going through final testing. With Blockchain, networks are being launched, and development is continuing, while the network is live. There is at times the feeling of repairing and improving a car as it is hurtles down the road.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4RHTV8to6H6UPupm2wQJ1w.jpeg" /><figcaption>“Can you imagine if this was moving?”</figcaption></figure><p>Consequently, our communication strategy has necessarily evolved over the lifetime of this project. Some of this has been due to the needs of the project as it has moved from an ERC20, to an ERC20 with a test network, to a fully launched blockchain, and all the development that has gone on in the ~9 months since launch. We have also been mindful of the successes and failures we have witnessed in the broader blockchain market. Finally, we always try to take feedback from what we try; to expand that which works, and to restrict or abandon entirely that which does not.</p><h3>Evolving Communication</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*iXsGAhrafsPkTBkhWkgs0w.png" /></figure><p>The QRL Whitepaper was the first significant communication of the QRL project. It was like the Declaration of Independence — it proclaimed a notion, and spoke into existence an idea, whose promise was later fulfilled. Many of the ideas espoused in the Declaration were a bit different upon delivery to the real world (in the form of the Constitution). Similarly, the way a blockchain is described in its whitepaper, is usually a bit different to how it appears following its genesis block (let alone after its first hard fork). Our blockchain, and how we talk about it, is like many others in this regard.</p><p>When I first started with QRL in September of 2017, it was in the midst of a bull-run that was about to go parabolic. In that crowded field of ERC20s, Bitconnect drama, and the ongoing fallout from the Bitcoin Cash fork, the name of the game was distinguishing ourselves from a crowded field. Simple things, like name recognition and a basic understanding that quantum computing existed, were still lacking in the space. The accelerated pace of public appearances at conferences, expos, etc in 2018 was in no small part our effort to jump-start awareness.</p><p>As a reminder, our 2018 appearances were:</p><ul><li><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/event-blockdelhi-conference-february-21st-3a15fe318302">BlockDelhi 2018</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/apac-blockchain-conference-2018-3817679b45b">APAC Blockchain 2018</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/global-blockchain-expo-2018-next-week-77afb5a9c61c">Global Blockchain Expo 2018</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-dc-finances-high-tech-family-office-meetings-b7fe8067d40d">DC Finance’s New York High Tech Family Office Meeting</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/consensus-conference-next-week-63f206bd0641">Consensus 2018</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/reflecting-on-my-evening-with-the-financial-services-club-in-london-573d5713f001">Financial Services Club of London</a></li><li>Crypto Valley Conference 2018</li><li>New York FinTech Week</li><li>Voice of Blockchain 2018</li><li><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/discover-blockchains-conference-next-week-dab6e0b8651b">Discover Blockchains</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/crypto-block-conference-this-week-1a8f4d1d0cc4">CryptoBlockCon Las Vegas</a></li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*HEiyBL5dPNItRJhgkoFUjA.png" /></figure><p>We were on 4 continents, 5 countries, and 8 cities. We spoke to a variety of audiences with different levels of technical education, and were happy to note that, as the year went on, a growing portion of those we met at conferences had already heard of the project. Increasingly, people we spoke with at events were even aware of the inevitable intersection of blockchain and Quantum Computing. This was, of course, due to more than just our outreach efforts, as QC had been in the news, and in the news connected to blockchain, more in 2018 than in 2017. We expect that trend to continue through 2019.</p><h3>Structural Needs</h3><p>The needs of the QRL project, like any software development endeavor, has changed over time, and will continue to change moving forward. Our development staff has increased, and decreased, as the needs of the project have changed. One of the engines of decentralization long-desired by the project (and many in the community), is the QRL Foundation. As <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-january-29-february-4-2019-93abe4d5a886">previously noted</a>, the foundation is located in Switzerland, where it currently sits in a sort of probationary period. We will have a dedicated blog on it when that period is concluded, and we might more freely discuss it.</p><p>One question we have received in various forms through multiple channels is, “What role will the QRL Foundation play?” — as previously noted, there is a limit to the amount of detail that we can go into regarding this currently. However, it is no secret that the QRL Foundation is there to help ensure the greater decentralization, and overall health, of the QRL network. More generally, it is also there to potentially be a resource for any other organization associated with, or connected to, the QRL network. It is impossible to proclaim unilaterally how this will manifest, but it is our goal to have the QRL Foundation provide utility to those associated with the network.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*aTkwjKvism6D_Oxh1on82A.jpeg" /></figure><p>When a building is constructed, everyone can see the broad progress being made. When a blockchain network is developed, everyone can see the public progress on GitHub. One major difference, of course, is that it does not take an expert in construction to recognize when a building has added on a few floors, or put in the windows. However, it does take a more-than-moderate understanding of coding, and blockchain networks, to even be able to understand most of what is in any given project’s GitHub. Furthermore, any work that goes into features, fixes, or other elements that ultimately, for whatever reason, are not integrated into the main project, goes entirely unnoticed. This is all before one can evaluate whether or not the work that is in a given project’s GitHub is even functional, unique, or relevant to what the project is trying to ostensibly achieve.</p><p>Even work that does end up in the codebase, but which is more “under the hood” change than visible change (like converting repositories to different languages, for example), can go largely unnoticed, but oftentimes represents a significant amount of time and effort.</p><h3>Moving Forward</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*B7PaF2B785Heps6u4cY28A.jpeg" /></figure><p>As previously articulated, one of the goals of the QRL project is to decentralize as many aspects of the network, its maintenance, and its development as is reasonable. We have never lost sight of that goal, and one of the milestones on the road to achieving it has always been the QRL Foundation.</p><p>It has been intimated in this blog, and elsewhere, but to state it again; the full arrival of the QRL Foundation will not be an isolated event. Rather, it will reverberate out into the QRL ecosystem, in beneficial and productive ways. Patience is a virtue not often found in the blockchain space, and with good reason; the majority of people in the space have witnessed unprecedented growth, and want to see its return. We are trying to not rush anything, because nothing makes a trip take longer than having to retrace one’s steps.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ea697177d0ce" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/communication-and-structure-ea697177d0ce">Communication and Structure</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>What went on at QRL the previous week</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*N8C-3wo52jWHtfkBSZjj0g.png" /></figure><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This week’s blog will be slightly shorter than usual. The past week at QRL was just as productive as ever — however there was less than usual that we can talk about in real time. We can say that we had some discussions this week about the future shape of the blockchain ecosystem that were very thought provoking. We hope to be able to announce the fruits of such discussions in the coming months, but for today, here’s what we can talk about.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*B9uOpbTTjyn3PNrW29fflA.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>Mobile Wallet: </strong>Solved issue showing Sent (instead of Received) for multiple outputs transactions</li><li><strong>Mobile Wallet: </strong>Fixed app crashing on transaction send issue</li><li><strong>Mobile Wallet: </strong>Remove the refresh button on the Send/Receive screen</li><li><strong>theqrl.org:</strong> Added “Academia” section</li></ul><h3>Decentralization</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*663Xv2kT-QqbYmx2abIeLw.png" /></figure><p>Decentralization is one of the core concepts of blockchain technology. Whether it is a public chain or a private one, decentralization is one of the unique (and valuable) features of blockchain. The ability to have all data on a given network in every node, such that any given node can reconstruct the entire network, is in many ways an evolution of the network tenacity first demonstrated by the Internet. As we are all aware, decentralization is more than just a technological perspective in the blockchain/cryptocurrency space; it is a perspective on all types of organization.</p><p>Cryptocurrency users, generally, want all things decentralized. The first blockchain, Bitcoin, is an excellent (if not terribly imitable) example of decentralization. With an anonymous founder that has remained silent for the overwhelming majority of the life of the chain, no official central authority, and a worldwide community of developers, Bitcoin has set the bar high. For most projects, replicating Bitcoin’s decentralization identically is not an option. That does not stop decentralization from being a good and proper goal; it just means that it must come in different forms for different projects in different contexts.</p><p>At QRL, decentralization has been something that we have had as a commitment from the very outset of the project; and it is something that we are still striving towards today. Some of the more recent changes to the website reflect this, such as the <a href="https://theqrl.org/#contributors">Contributors</a> section. Other changes will be coming later on, but we wanted to reiterate our commitment to decentralization here, and make it clear that it still a priority of the project, and will remain so going forward.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=a53b77d1601f" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-march-19-25-2019-a53b77d1601f">Last Week in QRL March 19–25, 2019</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
