            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Last Week in QRL May 28th — June 3rd</h3><p><em>Development Updates, Community Updates, Token Migration Reminder</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aUi4DIEPy6zXXUqbC5Fk1g.png" /></figure><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Last week saw our mobile wallets get out into the wider community, to wonderful reception. We truly appreciate all of the feedback, from praise to constructive criticism, and have taken it all into proper account as we move forward. This pas week has us moving closer towards the closure of automatic token migration (more on this below), as well as the one year anniversary of our blockchain launch! Expect regular reminders about the closure of automatic migration both here, and on our other social channels, over the next 12 days.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LHGtskpMp3zdQywz_jjicw.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>go-qrl</strong>: Rate limiter added to Go QRL public API</li><li><strong>mobile: </strong>Roadmap agreed for mobile app v2 and v3/beyond</li><li><strong>node: </strong>Python node (master branch) now has additional API function of data directory size (i.e. chain size)</li></ul><h3>Community</h3><p>We will announce the winner of the Community Nomination for May in a separate blog, probably later in the week.</p><h3>Token Migration Reminder</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NXPaycjJv_7d4RGQBXoKrw.jpeg" /></figure><p><strong>AUTOMATIC TOKEN MIGRATION ENDS JUNE 15, 2019 2000 UTC (</strong><a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/tokenmigration/countdown/"><strong>Countdown</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p><p>As we announced back in April in a <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/automatic-qrl-token-migration-end-date-845f94e3f6d9">dedicated blog</a>, automatic migration will be closed as of <strong>JUNE 15, 2019 2000 UTC.</strong></p><p>This will <strong>not </strong>mark the complete removal of user’s ability to migrate ERC20’s. However, currently the process is <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/tokenmigration/countdown/#migration-steps"><strong>automatic</strong></a><strong> </strong>and can be completed in its entirety by the user on their own. After <strong>JUNE 15, 2019 2000 UTC</strong>, the process will be <a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/tokenmigration/countdown/#steps-after-june-15th"><strong>manual</strong></a><strong>,</strong> require interacting with The QRL team in some capacity, and may take an <strong>indeterminate amount of time</strong>. <em>Additionally</em>, each manual migration will be evaluated on a <strong>case-by-case basis</strong>.</p><p>This cannot be stressed enough: every user with ERC20s remaining in their possession, <strong>please</strong> migrate them to main-network Quanta on the QRL blockchain as soon as it is reasonably possible for you to do so.</p><p>We have seen a wonderful showing from users so far, with the number of ERC20’s remaining dwindling by the day. Ensuring that as much of the token population is migrated before <strong>JUNE 15, 2019 2000 UTC </strong>is a priority for the team, so expect more reminders over the next 12 days as we advance towards the end of automatic migration.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d598ed1919c0" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-may-28th-june-3rd-d598ed1919c0">Last Week in QRL May 28th — June 3rd</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Given the decentralized, international, internet-based nature of cryptocurrency, it is no surprise that people want easy and secure access to their cryptocurrency wallets, wherever they are. That dream has now been realized in the form of the QRL mobile wallet.</p><p>At QRL, empowering our users is always on our mind, and a fast, functional mobile wallet interface is a necessary element in the pursuit of that goal. Today, we are happy to announce that the QRL Mobile Wallet is fully launched on both Android and iOS devices. You can find them on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/qrl-wallet/id1458620542?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Apple Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theqrl">Google Play Store</a>.</p><p>We cannot emphasize enough the hard work and dedication that Adem, our Mobile Developer, has put into these applications, and we are very thankful for him (you can go thank him yourself at his Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/ademcan_net">here</a>).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1013/1*gOnedxZdCA-hPfwcbN_HHA.png" /></figure><p>As the above images indicate, some of the functionality available to users of the mobile wallet include (but are not limited to):</p><ul><li>Offline wallet creation</li><li>Multiple wallet support</li><li>Send/Receive transactions</li><li>QR code integration</li></ul><p>A Few Notes:</p><ul><li>The QRL Mobile Wallet App is not available in China</li><li>The application may take some time to be added to the search indexes of the Google and Apple stores, respectively. However, you can access them via our links (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theqrl">Google</a>) (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/qrl-wallet/id1458620542?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Apple</a>), and they should appear in searches soon.</li></ul><p>Between the <a href="https://wallet.theqrl.org/">web wallet</a>, <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-wallet/releases/">desktop wallet</a>, <a href="https://shop.ledger.com/pages/ledger-live">Ledger integration</a>, and now the mobile wallet, there is a well-rounded variety of options for any given user to access their Quanta.</p><p>We are always looking to improve our current offerings, as well as to identify and pursue those things we have not yet considered. To that end, we are always appreciative of constructive feedback from our wonderful community of users. Please feel free to let us know on <a href="https://discord.gg/V5ZDUAr">Discord</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/qrledger">Twitter</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/mobile-wallet/issues">GitHub</a>, how you like the mobile app and if there are any improvements we should consider.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=e3014dd79d8e" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/the-qrl-mobile-wallet-is-officially-launched-e3014dd79d8e">The QRL Mobile Wallet is Officially Launched!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

More generally, the Consensus conference in NYC as well as some dynamic price action, has had the wider blockchain community aflutter with all sorts of proclamations and predictions. As ever, completing one task at QRL just leaves room to attack the next one. In the (relatively) near future we will be able to announce more fun utility added to the QRL ecosystem. For now, the best of what we can talk about is below.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gppZaKrYawY4Vgf0I_uJVg.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>qrl-ledger:</strong> Updating app (adding multitree support)</li><li><strong>block-explorer:</strong> Fix for Q/q in route on address page</li><li><strong>block-explorer: </strong>Bump explorer-helpers version</li></ul><h3>Token Migration Update</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wUksQw4Xu9i1NuyY2ZBRUw.jpeg" /></figure><p><strong>AUTOMATIC TOKEN MIGRATION ENDS JUNE 15, 2019 2000 UTC (</strong><a href="https://docs.theqrl.org/tokenmigration/countdown/"><strong>Countdown</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p><p>As we announced back in April in a <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/automatic-qrl-token-migration-end-date-845f94e3f6d9">dedicated blog</a>, automatic migration will be closed as of <strong>JUNE 15, 2019 2000 UTC. </strong>This will not mark the complete removal of user’s ability to migrate ERC20’s.

For those unaware, Keybase is a catalog of connected identities that utilizes cryptographic proofs to link profiles. For example, you can currently link your GitHub, Twitter, Reddit, Bitcoin or ZCash addresses (along with ~200 other services) currently to prove your identity. Starting today, QRL addresses may also be used in this manner to prove your digital identity. Obviously, if your QRL address is proving your identity, then your identity is also associated with that QRL address, so make sure you are comfortable with that address being publicly known before associating it with your Keybase account.</p><p>Our <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/qrl-and-keybase-84968003bca2">previous blog</a> has more detailed instructions, but here is a quick rundown:</p><ul><li>In the Keybase app click on the <em>Add more identities </em>button, and select QRL from the list</li><li>Enter your QRL address where it asks for your “username”</li><li>When you submit, it will open a page that looks like this:</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HA9BQKa6y7U_Yzv1wAW0zg.png" /></figure><ul><li>Do not hit “Submit” on this page yet!!

One of our very own community members, Discord user dr_gonzo, attended the <a href="https://bcisummit.com/summit-2019.html">BCI Summit on May 10 in New York City</a>, whose <a href="https://bcisummit.com/agenda-S2019.html">agenda</a> included a panel on Quantum Computer’s Destruction of Security &amp; Blockchain.</p><p>The BCI Summit members and attendees consisted of major accredited investors and C-suite executives from some of the largest companies around the world, including IBM, Barclays, D-Wave, UBS, and more. The “Quantum Computer’s Destruction of Security &amp; Blockchain” panel consisted of industry heavyweights such as the Quantum Computing Lead for NASA, the head of Symantec Ventures, and a Researcher of Quantum Theory for IBM. While the panel focused primarily on alternative algorithms and mining, it also took questions, including one from dr_gonzo who asked about the vulnerability of ECDSA, and noted that projects like our very own QRL exist to address it.</p><p>It is increasingly clear that quantum computing, and the means to resist it on a cryptographic level, are becoming more mainstream topics for discussion. Major institutional players are waking up to the fundamental threat of quantum computing technology to other cryptocurrencies. Thanks to Discord users dr_gonzo for his attendance, and PQAdvantage for helping facilitate the opportunity.</p><p>We are always happy to hear about the wonderful things our community members are getting up to, and, where appropriate, are happy to highlight them in this space. Please feel free to reach out to us on Discord, Twitter, Reddit, or send an email with your cool story to <a href="mailto:adam@theqrl.org">adam@theqrl.org</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=4f70f54e5333" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/last-week-in-qrl-may-7-13-4f70f54e5333">Last Week in QRL May 7–13</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Now, without further ado…</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mxCu4J3xHZt-qgs1L62rHA.png" /></figure><p>We are pleased to announce that this month’s QRL Community Nomination Award goes to <a href="https://github.com/IMac318">GitHub user IMac318</a> (reddit handle: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Definitely_Not_IMac">Definitely_Not_IMac</a>)! Here’s what IMac318 had to tell us about themselves and their relationship to the QRL:</p><blockquote>I was someone who got into crypto during the December 2017 hype, because the idea of a trust-less, decentralized financial system seemed like a fascinating and revolutionary idea. Of course, a blockchain’s usefulness is entirely reliant on its security, and while Bitcoin and others seemed virtually impenetrable from classical computing attacks, my background in physics made me wonder how it would stand up to quantum computing attacks.</blockquote><blockquote>It didn’t take very much research to see that nearly all blockchains were vulnerable to quantum computers, but very few people in the space seemed to be aware of this. I figured that any crypto that was serious about being a long-term store of value should be taking this threat seriously, and QRL was the only team that was. Since joining the community, I’ve continued to see future-oriented decisions from the project’s leadership, and it has been exciting to see the progress that has been made in QRL ecosystem. I can’t wait to see what the future holds for this project!</blockquote><p>IMac318 has been a positive member of the QRL community for some time now, and is also the author of <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/tree/master/2.Proposals/1.%20Open/7%20-%20Support%20Tokenization%20of%20Securities">QIP-007: Support Tokenization of Securities</a>. As always, we <em>highly </em>encourage anyone with interest to <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/blob/master/README.md">check out how to submit a QIP</a>. It remains one of the most direct ways to contribute to the QRL ecosystem, as well as the most direct way to make your desires regarding the continued development of QRL known.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ac364919ff9f" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/april-community-nomination-award-ac364919ff9f">April Community Nomination Award</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

At QRL, we are nearing the 1 year anniversary of our blockchain launch (coming in late June). This past week has seen some press coverage (which will be featured moving forward in our “In The News” section of these blogs), development efforts, as well as things we can’t talk about. For what we can, there are highlights below.</p><h3>Development</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*z0AJeiYe_9qltVgp2g7zkw.jpeg" /></figure><ul><li><strong>qrl-wallet: </strong>Make build version dynamic</li><li><strong>message-transaction-encoding: </strong>List of encoding bytes for various services using QRL message transactions</li><li><strong>qrl-docker: </strong>Adding auto-generated CircleCI 2.0 config file</li></ul><h3>Community</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UnmlJxDvSBsLOXxfMx9MPQ.png" /></figure><p>As we do every month, we have another QRL Community Nomination Winner this month! Unfortunately, we have not gotten a response from them yet as to whether or not they would like to state anything about their relationship with the QRL network or how they came to be involved in our community. We will include a full write-up of April’s winner in a separate blog later this week, or in next week’s “Last Week in QRL” blog.</p><h3>In The News</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BBJhh7x3g8Va2LaORmo_wA.jpeg" /></figure><p>We are going to be highlighting when QRL ends up in the news, or an interview with one of our team members is published, in these weekly blogs moving forward. We will include a link to the article, a brief summary, and our involvement (if there was any).</p><p>This section won’t necessarily show up every week, but it will appear intermittently as needed. As always, if I have missed any articles, podcasts, etc in this rundown, please email them to me at adam@theqrl.org and they will be included in the next week’s blog.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>An introduction to the newest QIP</em></p><p>On April 19th, GitHub user <a href="https://github.com/IMac318">IMac318</a> submitted the latest QRL Improvement Proposal (QIP) — “QIP-007: Support Tokenization of Securities.” (<a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/tree/master/2.Proposals/1.%20Open/7%20-%20Support%20Tokenization%20of%20Securities">link to QIP</a>) We are always excited to see new QIPs pop up on GitHub, especially when they originate from within our community of users. Certainly, tokenization of securities is an issue that is being debated in various iterations throughout the blockchain world. Security tokens generally, and Security Token Offerings (STOs) more specifically, have risen to the forefront of many debates regarding the next wave of functionality to hit the blockchain ecosystem.</p><p>This blog will provide a general overview of the QIP, but you should feel free to check out our <a href="https://theqrl.org/protocol-updates/">QIP section of the website</a>, or jump in on the conversation <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/pull/15">directly on GitHub</a>.</p><h3>Abstract</h3><blockquote>One of the biggest potential use cases of blockchains in the future is the tokenization of existing securities to be bought and sold by valid parties. Being the only existing blockchain that is quantum resistant from genesis and adding the functionality of smart contracts, QRL is in a unique spot to capitalize on this opportunity. The QRL team should evaluate whether the functionality of the smart contracts that are currently in progress can support the tokenization of securities on the QRL blockchain. If that is not the case, the team should consider adding additional functionality that allows for such tokenization.</blockquote><h3>Motivation</h3><p>Given the length of the motivation statement, I have only included 2 of the paragraphs below, with a link to the full text at the bottom.</p><blockquote>The current usefulness of blockchain is highly debated, and there is much conversation about what “killer app” will eventually drive adoption. One current use of blockchain is speculation, and it is very attractive in this area due to the ability to buy fractions of a coin or token. In contrast, many traditional assets require the purchase of an integer number of the asset. For example, it is difficult to obtain a fraction of a stock or real estate property…</blockquote><blockquote>The purpose of this QIP is to urge the QRL team to evaluate whether or not the in-progress smart-contract functionality can support the creation and exchange of security tokens. QRL smart contracts are limited in functionality compared to ETH (where security token standards are currently being created), so the author does not automatically assume that such functionality currently exists. If it does not, consideration should be given to add such functionality.</blockquote><p>Full text <a href="https://github.com/theQRL/qips/pull/15/commits/4c0d57f7445252e0dcf9db578c948e5ed5c754a5#diff-6ca84c8a1de35376f47274be3c33c93c">here</a></p><h3>Specification</h3><blockquote>QRL already has the ability to create tokens, but to be compliant with regulations, it must be possible to restrict transactions of security tokens between wallets if the sending and receiving wallets do not meet certain criteria (example: <a href="https://thesecuritytokenstandard.org/);">https://thesecuritytokenstandard.org/);</a> therefore, it would have to be possible to make these checks before a token transaction is admitted to the blockchain.</blockquote><h3>Implementation</h3><blockquote>Several entities are working on platforms for tokenization of securities. Polymath, Harbor, Securrency, and tZero are prominent examples. It may be worth reaching out to them for evaluation and implementation.</blockquote><p>We continue to be very proud of the QIP system and are grateful for how the community has thus far embraced it. We hope to continue to see new, interesting and timely QIPs pop up intermittently as time goes on. Hopefully, they will help shape and direct development of the QRL network in such a way that will allow the network to be the best it can be.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d885e8d9aedc" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/qip-007-support-tokenization-of-securities-d885e8d9aedc">QIP-007: Support Tokenization of Securities</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger">The Quantum Resistant Ledger</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
