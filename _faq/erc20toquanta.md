title:  "What will the QRL token migration process look like?"

Before the commencement of our token migration there will be a blog and video guide outlining everything in detail on converting your QRL ERC20 tokens into QRL Quanta. 

With that said, the process in *general* will be as follows:

1. Make your QRL Wallet and QRL Address. This can be done from our [webwallet](https://wallet.theqrl.org), your Ledger, or your node.
2. Go to The QRL Token Migration Web Page and put in your fresh QRL address created from step #1 (The Token migration page will be revealed at a later date)
3. Get your Ethereum Burn Address to send QRL ERC20 to.
4. Anytime you send QRL ERC20 to the reusable Ethereum Burn Address, QRL Coins are deposited 1:1 into your QRL Wallet.
