A user will generate a QRL wallet, the address of which will be used by a team-made application that converts the address to an ERC20 burn address. The application will watch for a deposit, at which point it will insert that balance into the Genesis block of QRL.

If you do not do this process prior to mainnet, you will still be able to do this, but there will need to be a transaction made and sent to your wallet, paying a small QRL fee as a result. This is why we recommend using the web application, in order to gauruntee your full balance upon mainnet launch.

It would be ideal for you to send your QRL to this wallet from your personal ERC20 wallet, that way, all of the funds are coming from a single source
