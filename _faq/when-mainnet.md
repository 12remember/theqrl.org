The launch of Mainnet has, from the outset, been at the mercy of two main factors - internal testing, and external auditing. Right now we are in the **External Auditing** stage, which is the final technical stage before Mainnet. As we get closer to the end of our external audits, a launch date of mainnet will be announced on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/qrledger), [Medium](https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger), and [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/QRL).

For those interested. On testnet, you can:

- Create a [wallet](https://wallet.theqrl.org): From there you create tokens & send and receive Quanta.
- See transactions on the [explorer](https://explorer.theqrl.org)
- Run a [node](https://docs.theqrl.org/mining/full-node/)
- Join a [testnet pool](https://mineqrl.org)
