Upon release of mainnet, the Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) will be a first of its kind, future-proof post quantum value store and decentralized communication layer which tackles the threat Quantum Computing will pose to cryptocurrencies. 

This is backed by provably secure, peer-reviewed [XMSS](https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/484.pdf) (instead of 256-bit ECDSA) with a proof-of-work(POW) algorithm,â€ŠCryptonight v7, which will later be hard forked to Proof of Stake.

Also included will be:

- A [web wallet](https://wallet.theqrl.org) to create tokens & send and receive Quanta.
- Desktop Apps (windows, mac, Linux)
- An [explorer](https://explorer.theqrl.org)
- gRPC with protobuf for a powerful API
- Post Quantum Resistant Ephemeral messaging layer utilizing [Dilithium](https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/) and [Kyber](https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/)

*Right now QRL is trading as an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain while we develop the QRL blockchain. It will be exchanged at a ratio of 1:1 at mainnet. The process will be simple, easy, and articulated when it comes time.*
