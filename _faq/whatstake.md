QRL will be released with PoW, to get started mining you can follow our [guide here](http://docs.theqrl.com/mining/pool-mining/)

When we later release with our PoS consensus model, there will be another guide on that in our documentation. Generally however, you will need.

1. QRL (1 or more)
2. A working computer (something as powerful as a Raspberry Pi or greater)
3. Working internet
