In cryptocurrency systems, keeping your private key(s) hidden is the most important thing in securing your funds.
Staking on the QRL network does not require you to share any secret information with anybody. Our source code is open, so anyone can verify this.
Additionally, we will offer a means for 'secure offline staking' whereby users are able to stake without ever having to expose their private key(s) to the world wide web.

Funds are locked while a node is staking and can be retrieved at any time by ending staking participation.
